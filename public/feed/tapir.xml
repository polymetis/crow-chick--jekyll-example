   <title>A Christmas Carol<h2>From an Unbeliever</h2></title>

   &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book, to raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;cite&gt;Charles Dickens &lt;em&gt;December, 1843&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far too many people this year have asked me why I celebrate Christmas while being an atheist. Some seem to suggest that it may within the margins of hypocrisy, others suggest that I have some lingering bit of Christianity floating about the back works of my pathology, or even that I may be a closeted Christian. To all of which I say Bah and Humbug! But in deference to the recent death of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html?pagewanted=all&quot;&gt;Christopher Hitchens&lt;/a&gt; I will now explain myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short version is that despite the fact that on the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of December is a day that I will have a tree up and been seen as unusually Merry I do not I am not celebrate anything particularly Christian. And no, I am not referring to the long a torrid history involving solstice holiday tradition. I am not paying homage to any elder gods or any recent new age reinterpretation of vaguely pagan traditions. What I am celebrating is a very human tradition that has been instilled by a very mortal man. That’s right,  Charles Dickens. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this may seem a little counter intuitive to most but that is because a great many people don’t know the history behind our modern Christmas tradition as opposed to fiddling about with various ancient elements while decrying the terribly tacky and ostentatious habits of the Baby Boom. In fact Christmas nearly became what Easter has become. A trivial holiday that while the religious take is seriously the large majority use it as an excuse to indulge themselves in a few sweets. The difference was made by Charles Dickens and his work &lt;em&gt;A Christmas Carol&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1843 Christmas was falling under the wheels of progress. Taking a half-day, a special meal, and fulfilling the requirements at church but not anything more than that; simular to our modern easter. It was simply the way of the times. There was no real antagonism to the act. Merely just the changes in the social-economic winds. And it would have stayed gone along that path sure enough it was not for the fact that Charles Dickens liked the holiday both as a child and as an adult. He then sat down a penned the classic we know toady, well approximately, as both a serial and as love letter to the holiday of his youth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we must remember this is Charles Dickens and not some schmuck with a pen and fond memory of his childhood. The Dickensian ethos is much more than that, in fact it is much more the Christmas Story – meaning the one involving the Birth in Bethlehem, which is why there was a sudden resurgence of Christmas traditions in response to the book. It was not the birth of some god with little relation to the daily life of England but rather a human being of modern times. This resurgence is what forms the basis of our modern traditions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dickensian iteration of the tradition, which forms the backbone of our modern incarnation of the holiday, is a reflective one. An opportunity to gaze into ourselves; not to gaze upon high. Just look at the plot. Scrooge is forced to look at what he is doing with his life, what he has done, what others are doing, and what will come if he continues on his merry way and he then desires to be a better man and &lt;em&gt;most importantly&lt;/em&gt; does so at the end. The supernatural – the ghosts – and natural – the length of the night – backdrop is just there support that message of a plight to look upon ourselves.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To repeat there is nothing truly supernatural in this message. It is not the coming of a God on Earth. It is merely the story of a man wanting to make both himself and the world around him better. This maybe somewhat Christian, given Jesus’ message, but it is also Buddhist, and has a compatibility with many other religions especially when shoved through the current politically correct rose tinted glasses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is message I choose to celebrate every year and I think the major part of the success the modern western christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I am not much for the ‘God Bless Us Everyone’ stick let me close with this.”May we forgive our past mistakes, try to wake up as better people, and make a better world.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;floatright calig&quot;&gt;Merry Christmas&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

   <title>Cowboys And Aliens: A Movie That Is Not About Arizona's Immigration Policy</title>
   <link href="/2011/08/20/cowboys-and-aliens-a-movie-that-is-not-about-arizonas-immigration-policy/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-20T17:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/08/20/cowboys-and-aliens-a-movie-that-is-not-about-arizonas-immigration-policy</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;I will concede that &lt;em&gt;Cowboys And Aliens&lt;/em&gt; is an enjoyable movie and when you go to movie, much like &lt;em&gt;Snakes on a Plane&lt;/em&gt; of yesteryear, if you expect more than what is the movie title then you are going to be disappointed. So I ask myself: Were there Cowboys? Yes. Were there Aliens? Affirmative. Was the Kurgen from Highlander in it? Yes but that wasn’t on the poster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the movie should be a rousing success. Right. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my low expectations it left me empty. It is like listening to a player piano. It seemed more as a background activity with no anima. Just a piece by the numbers that will most people will just watch as an accompaniment to the sound of popcorn grazing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This movie hit all the right notes for all the westerns of yesteryear and the cast was pitch perfect but even with all of that you could actually feel the sprockets digging in and moving the film across rather than have a true emotional impact of a true performance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reels lack any form of art but what is sad is everyone involved is not only good but excellent in their role. The script, however, is shit and it pays tribute to the fact that the five credited writers were all working at different times and the movie studios were asking for draft after draft after draft. If it wasn’t for Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig being signed to the project, with specific roles, then the movie would probably stayed in development hell where the script belonged. Alas it did not and everyone just went through the paces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about it the movie could have been made better with some minor script level edits. If you were to make Harrison Ford an unlikable sheriff and remove the Sam Rockwell character completely then you have not only a better movie but also a half hour shorter movie.  Furthermore, I think given the talent on screen if you could have just made the antagonism between the settlers and natives stronger, instead of assumed, and brought in the aliens as a antagonist then you could have had a very strong message about how the whereas what is past maybe prologue but the what is key is the future and forgiveness. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie has this better movie sitting so close to the surface that it is a shame that they couldn’t bother to play the piece with feeling.   &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Some More Thoughts Concerning Education</title>
   <link href="/2011/08/19/some-more-thoughts-concerning-education/"/>
   <updated>2011-08-19T17:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/08/19/some-more-thoughts-concerning-education</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;h4 id=&quot;due-to-the-fact-that-extra-creditz-has-left-the-escapist-and-is-moving-to-patvhttppenny-arcadecompatv-the-video-will-be-down-temporarily-i-will-repost-the-video-when-it-comes-online&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Due to the fact that Extra Creditz has left the Escapist and is moving to &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;quot;http://penny-arcade.com/patv&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;PAtv&lt;/a&gt; the video will be down temporarily. I will repost the video when it comes online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must start with an honest declaration. Despite the fact that I love some of the ideas presented in the above video I do, however, loathe the application of the term ‘Gamify’ to education. I have encountered far to many exceedingly trivial Ph.D. holders that obviously gamed their way through the current education system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this semantic discomfort I still say that most of what is said is quite correct but it lacks ambition. The current system has axiomatic problems that seem to transcend each new system developed despite the fact with each coming decade the system is ‘fixed’ by disinterested committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So like any one worth their salt, not many in my experience, let me add to James Portnow, Daniel Floyd and Allison Theus of &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;quot;http://twitter.com/extracreditz&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Extra Creditz&lt;/a&gt; by starting from renewed first principles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;formal-education-renting-a-tuxedo&quot;&gt;Formal Education: Renting a Tuxedo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put everyone on notice, by formal education I mean an educational system that is built on theories that are derived from &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;the forms&lt;/a&gt;. The two principle forms that seem to govern all the others are that students are ‘blank slates’ when you get them and that students must be built to in to a particular form. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘blank slate’ idea is from John Locke, some of you might know it as &lt;em&gt;Tabula Rasa&lt;/em&gt;, and it is simply experientially incorrect. The idea that citizens are built through education is a notion expounded by Rosseau in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile:_or,_On_Education&quot;&gt;Émile&lt;/a&gt;, which I should note is vaguely racist and openly misogynistic – not that either of those facts would destroy the core idea but it does annoy me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even feral children do not meet either the uncivilized or ‘blank slate’ axioms that each of these forms rely on. In fact if you look into the lives of feral children they do in fact learn from the extreme cruelty of isolation and those that put them into such a situation. I would not wish these lessons even upon my worst enemies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teachers may think that they have met this ‘blank slate’ impossibility but this is just born out of frustration. Also some students, and people in general, think that they know nothing due to persistent negative reinforcement by authoritative figures but in reality they may know a little something due to the fact that they happen to live in the world. All of this frustration can be offset by altering the teaching methods so that the tension  is more placed on the system rather then either the student of teacher. I will elaborate on this at a later juncture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This damage, which all participants of education feel in the current system, is caused by the curricula writers when they imagine their ideal student. They may claim that there is some basis for this imagining but really it is complete and utter &lt;em&gt;bullshit&lt;/em&gt;. The reality is they are attempting to shove a non-malleable substance in a mold and get shocked and offended that the creature that is removed from the mould is cranky, bruised, and not in the shape they intended.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One should always take a step back when someone make unverifiable claims. Even more if the person making the claim seems to have a barely tangental relationship with reality. These ideal students are to curricula as boogey men are to small children in the night. Really it’s just a shadow on the wall but sometimes, in the dark of night we can force ourselves to believe in these creations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shadow, for the curricula writers, is cast by the demands of the society at the time and illuminated with the traditions of schooling. Because of this we get a type of strange curve to knowledge acquisition in pre-university education.&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article-images/logostudent.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graphs equal validity&quot; class=&quot;floatright&quot; /&gt;
If you pay close attention  to the graph you will notice the student never quite hits the desired goal. This tension , which cannot be relieved without a modification in teaching strategy, is what is the major demotivational force in education today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, measuring yourself against an imaginary off-the-rack nonsense will just obliterate self esteem or give a false impression of intelligence just because you breezed through the obstacle course for one year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional problem, when working with such a model, is that the further away from the end goal that you are, as a student, the slower the material is doled out to you. This is seemly in spite of every developmental psychology study that suggests data acquisition and grammar structures are something that small children are good at. Meaning all the primary education system is largely wasted and as the world changes at the top end of the spectrum the low end of the graph gets increasing out of sync with desirable skills. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has already happened with mathematics. When my parents were at school Calculus was a university subject that you had to deal with and now people don’t go to university because they are made to fell stupid for the inability to cope with some inane minutiae of set theory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary grades have barely changed in the last century but the latter grades are being increasingly accelerated where the is a near universal problem of Secondary Education teachers keeping up with the demands of the curricula writers. The students are also having a problem given that in most of the western world standardized test scores are showing problems with coping.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There needs to be a dramatic restructuring of education from new first principles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;bespoke-education&quot;&gt;Bespoke Education&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to be rid of is this out of 100% against the ideal marking system. You either know something or you do not. Knowing 90% of something is as useless as knowing 20% of something if you are asked for the missing portion of information. There obviously needs to be a more a finely tuned way of dealing with what a student actually knows what to do and what they do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the video at the top of the page comes in. Extra Creditz correctly points out that the cumulative experience points system from role-playing games (rpgs) is psychologically helpful. I would like to take this a step further and use the skill tree concept from rpgs as well. For those that are unfamiliar with the system let me clear up my meaning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most role-playing games, in order to scale difficulty, there is a cumulative point system that corresponds with a number of conditions set by the game designers. The normal task is defeating some sort of beastie or something to that effect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A skill tree is implemented in some games and just allows the player to invest the experience points gained into particular skills that they think will best do them through out the game. In this case the player gets to choose how their talents will progress through the game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, smarter games scale the number of point that you received based on the relative level of your character versus the beastie, puzzle, or whatnot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we understand the basic mechanics that would be at play let me explain how they can be best utilized towards an educational telos rather than a final cinematic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially all we have to do is dispose with exams and develop an assignment system. This system would just have a rating for each assignment as it is developed. Obviously the assignments themselves will have a specific number of points assigned to them based on the merits of each assignment. There can be assumption that completely a certain number of of the assignments mean that the student can be accredited with whatever the theme of the assignment is; let us say 10 for visualizations sake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would be for an average student. A student that completes the assignment without mistakes should gain more points from the assignment thus getting accreditation faster and going through the system faster. A student that is having trouble can just do more of the assignments until they get it right through reenforcement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as the students rises up the skill tree lesser assignments in a larger topic will be worth less and less as they progress through the topic thus deinsensitivising doing work they already understand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another advantage is that if a student attempts to tackle an assignment that is beyond their abilities they can still be rewarded for the effort. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance if someone with the relative competency of a third grader in literature attempts to tackle Joyce’s &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt; and completely and utterly fails to understand the book then they can be rewarded for attempting to deal with complexity. This does not stop the kid from reading Encyclopaedia Brown or something age appropriate but doing something that is more challenging should not only be rewarded but also is a good life lesson. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bender_(Futurama)&quot;&gt;Bender&lt;/a&gt; put it “If you are not going to catch a fish you might as well not catch a big fish.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still I feel that such an assignment should be red penned into oblivion – so that the student can know what they did wrong – but it should be scaled against how much knowledge that they have actually attained. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is a little different from the formal education model that I spoke of because of scale and time. The current formal system is based on age but if it on an assignment based with smaller ideas you can not only better teach singular topics but have an accurate assessment with redundancy of what the student is actually capable of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, such a system doesn’t punish failure as harshly. Failure is not only part of life but a necessary part of life. With the the last 20 to 30 years of mark inflation and the general pressure to be perfect our system of education does not promote the occasional falling down. How else can we learn to pick ourselves back up? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nobody-expects-the-spanish-examiners&quot;&gt;Nobody Expects The Spanish Examiners&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I scoffed earlier, exams should be abolished in favour of the system above. Despite that fact that system of earning points through work rather than been unfairly concretizing into idiotic academic mores. There is &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; but the &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exams are a particularly useless by-product of the Cambridge chemistry department and the only reason we still use them is because we are used to the concept. It’s original intent was to make it easier for the Chemistry professors to figure out which of their students could remember what lessons so they could ascertain which student would be more likely to blow up when mixing things. Well the motive is probably not right but it is far more an amusing story than just Cambridge Chemistry professors of the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; being a boring and lazy sort that finds interaction with students an unhygienic affair. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How this became so wide spread was because humanity is lazy and boring sort that finds interacting with students an unhygienic affair.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that we, as a group, began experiencing this odd sort of Stockholm Syndrome with the concept of self worth being attached to testing to the point that we believe it now. But I ask you to think about an exam for a second. It is a list of questions that represent the ideas, or skills, that the test writer thinks are most important from the curriculum and then attempts to measure success with a time pressure element which never really exists in the real word; at least I have never been told to write a short essay on the fall of the Roman Empire in under 30 minutes but then again we all live different lives.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, exams have two additional and obvious problems with them. It does not allow to have a clear indication that you are better than the test, which despite many professors best efforts this does happen now and again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly exams have the exact same observed result as torture. Wait long enough and submit enough pressure the subject of either torture or examination will simply say what you want them whether they believe or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it is so effective it can even have the desirable result of making the subject believe in it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;curricula&quot;&gt;Curricula&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curricula is a major problem in today’s education system. They are treated like the last line of defence for the politically indefensible. There are book banning, which in my opinion is only one step removed from book burning, the concept of creationism inside a science classroom, and even text book kickbacks given to all the little school board people if I wish to extend the definition of the term people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This quite simply must stop. Not just because it is repugnant to me personally but there really is no defence for this level of stupidity. There just isn’t. What good does it to ban a book? For the children. No, they will read or see it at some point. It’s for yourself because a book may challenge you moral order and parents seem to be too lazy to defend the religion for question or believe in it so little that even the slightest questions will bring the house of cards down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how none of that had anything to do with the concerns of the education of the child and should it not be the concern of educators to actually educate rather than defend the parents of jam covered children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let us be done with this. The curriculum shall be set by the professional organisation of each topic that the schools teaches. This is the only course of action that makes sense in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the national association of biologists would be the ones to set curriculum on their own subject. They would do this with the idea that when a student comes out of the system they will have something to work with as a biologist-in-training. This way they student when working in a biology classroom is actually working as a very long term apprentice to a biologist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makes sense doesn’t it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would prevent any form of creationism from slipping into the biologists domain. Which is good because it has nothing to do with biology and a student should not be under any delusions that he could survive in the biologists world while rejecting evolution. They could, however, survive quite well in a variety of religious studies departments which curriculum can be set by the luminaries of the various religions from around the world. Furthermore, there would be nothing stopping a particular school board to teach a particular religion as a class. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, there should be some limits on the professional orginisations ability to change the curriculum. Maybe only once every decade, five years or some set term like that. A rule like this is merely there to keep fringe theories out of the earlier curricula so there will be less shocking changes to the system from one year to the next. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-tutors&quot;&gt;The Tutors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point it should be quite obvious that if such a system was to be taken on there would be need to be some adjustment to the way teachers are set up. Wait, there is no need to get huffy, if everything I say is taken on then there should actually be less work for teachers. Although as the title suggests the would have to give up the teacher moniker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students, at any age, do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; need things pointed out to them, the etymology of teacher, in the 21 century. We live in a world were universal cellular internet service is edging along to an affordable level. What students need to do is learn how to find and express notions and ideas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tutor, to watch over, is a more desirable analogy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would be still need to be lectures on a particular topics obviously but if we followed a somewhat Oxbridge model loosely through out the education system this would free up time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you not familiar with Oxford and Cambridge’s antics, all this means it that the class would go somewhere else to attend lectures while being under guided by their tutor. Since, in Canada, French is taught in a separate classroom by another teacher with no detrimental effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another problem is the unionization of teachers which I would like to change to guild of tutors. I grant this is the most obviously pie-in-the-sky thought but it is still a valid point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unions assume victimisation. It is their raison d’être and there can be no getting away from that. It is also true, given the nature of liberal governments, that they would be quite pleased to give teachers absolutely nothing, from benefits to pay, so that they can balance the deficit other such perennial excuses. My proposition is to start a tutor guild. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A guild would be there to assure standards and would not allow anyone to guide students without having some sort of placement within the Guild structure. As a guild members what is needed to keep these standards would be handled – e.g. health care. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now some may think this is an anachronism but it’s not. This is how the (legal) bar is organized. They take care of their own without any need to play the victim despite being another arm of the government that could very easily be made cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the teachers (read tutors if you are playing along with me) could copy such a schema then the public relations for one of the greater vocations can that much better. To alter this role, however, of the educator does require a few more adjustments to the system beyond a title change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-malady-of-marking&quot;&gt;The Malady of Marking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number one complaint that I hear from any form of educator is the sheer volume of marking that is required in order for them to seem like they are doing their job. Despite the fact that they are not called markers. Since this is not a pleasant job and any mistake is actually more hazardous to the student rather than the marker perhaps some minor adjustments should be made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On second thought only one adjustment is needed. Let us separate the act of teaching from marking completely. Just give a dollar value for each assignment marked and allow teachers from around the country pick a chose how much marking they want to do based on their schedules through some sort of server. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several advantages to this system. On the educator side of things it will allow you to avoid marking assignments that you don’t want to mark or don’t have time for at that particular moment. It will also allow for time to be more focused on the students problems rather than the work produced. At least on a day to day basis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one more but significant advantage which is, based on the education of each educator, they may be able to mark certain assignments faster due to familiarity with certain elements of particular course. For instance, a person that wrote their undergrad honours thesis on King Lear might be able to mark King Lear assignments a lot faster than Hamlet assignments. This will allow each member of the guild to maximize the amount of money they can derive from their vocation through expertise rather then sycophancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student would no longer be able to rely on the relationship with their supervisor for their success in the education and would be used to the fact that implied meaning outside of the work does not help the work itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;grades-be-gone&quot;&gt;Grades Be Gone&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, there is no reason to measure people against imaginary standards. So there is no particular reason to keep students in grades. In a system like, I described  above, the students themselves would be the engine of their education. There are two exceptions though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that emotional development, from what others tell me at least, is vaguely,  dependent on being among people of a simular age group. I am not entirely sold on this idea but I am willing to entertain it to such a point that it would probably best to keep children in an age strata. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem is more of a logical problem. There are three generally accepted stages of education and it is nearly impossible to have any one tutor to be able to do all three equally well. So given this limit of educators then we should make limits on when a student can be considered advanced enough to go on to the next stage in their education. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three stages will be more or less akin to the current three partite system but with some specific adjustments so that the each system has a specific focus so there is less cross purposes that happen over the system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communicative&quot;&gt;Communicative&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be the first stage of education; the equivalent of primary or grammar school. Except for the fact that we need to stop schooling children for the early twentieth century and come to accept some features of the century to come. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that everything should be removed from the current system, or even some of the older atrophying systems, but rather to change the system in such a way that better fit the current needs rather than trying to shove all the current needs into the high school stage. Which seems to be the current stratagem – if there is one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this in mind I think that the core subjects of this phase of education should be: standard arithmetic – personally I think some of the basic ideas of algebra should be brought in here but I am in a very tiny minority on that point; basic language skills in at least two languages; computer programming; system of units and measure; and logic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three obvious addenda to the current primary goals of early seem to throw people for a loop so I will expand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-am-sorry-dave-but-i-cant-do-that&quot;&gt;I Am Sorry Dave but I Can’t Do That.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computers have reached the point where the devices are so fully integrated into society that rudimentary computer skills are necessary for everyone. It is now one of the basic components to communication and articulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teaching a child to use a computer from its basic principles is no different than teaching a child how to use a pencil and pen. Every class room I grew up in had the smell of pencil shaving a sharpener in the room. I learned how to fully use a pencil and even today, where I use a computer or a fountain pen for most things, I still know how to sharpen and use a pencil when the skill is needed. Otherwise I would be taking my pencil to the charming sharpener down the street. To assume a computer is somehow different is to enslave our children to the hideous care of IT departments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By basic principles I do not mean the scientific aspects, or &lt;em&gt;base&lt;/em&gt; principles, of how the computer functions. This may be interesting for a latter pursuit into the inner depths of computers but for such an early stage of education it would be better to focus on the technological requirements for computing abilities. These skills would be, basic programming – hence why I suggest algebra in early education since variable would have to introduced – and typesetting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these talents should be taught with open source tools for three very good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that it would simply keep the cost of software down so that money could be spent on useful things like staff for the schools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second reason is so that the skills that are being taught can not become outdated whereas proprietary software becomes outdated as business model. Printing, as in manually writing block letters, does not outdate after learning cursive. Both forms of writing remain useful for as long as users are willing to use them. If an entire generation of school children are used to a specific tool they will probably continue to use for much of their lives. You know like buying pencils despite the fact erasable pens exist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third reason is a bit more esoteric. This is because it is one of the few arguments &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman&quot;&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt; has managed to sail past me defences despite his particular brand of crazy. It is simply for the fact that if the child asks ‘how does this work?’ you can now present them with the code. Given the self direction I am relying on for a such a system it would be criminal not to be able to show the child the nuts-and-bolts of their tools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a programming language I would recommend something like Python, Ruby, or Perl just because they are open source and fairly easy to learn but all of that is interchangeable for such simple lessons that would be required at this early stage of education. I would just recommend a scripting language so the additional abstraction, in thought rather than computing, needed for compiling the code does not interfere with the workflow of learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formatting text though has a few problems with what particular format to chose for long term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem arises that the formats chosen as the default for educational use must have the staying power for a presumed 20 years of usefulness. There are only two formats with such a track record currently and both have their particular uses. Those two formats are LaTeX and HTML. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LaTeX, for the uninitiated, is the &lt;em&gt;de facto&lt;/em&gt; standard for publishing text on paper. It has been kicking around for about 30 years and has one of the slowest release cycles in the history of software – version 3 should be coming any decade now.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that LaTeX is not well suited for displaying text on a screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where HTML excels and the genearl standards for the markup for simple text have not changed all that much in 20 years. The problem with HTML though is that it does not excel in the typography department as shown through the world of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/ebookstandards/&quot;&gt;e-readers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for the interest of not having to deal with the minutiae of typography and browser standards my recommendation would be to absorb version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. Not the original, which is the one linked, mind you but one of the supersets that can export to either LaTeX or HTML. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious advantage is to this it that since Markdown is open source the education system would have some measure of control as to how it exports to every version number of either browser or LaTeX, mind you some programmers would have to hired to maintain the system, whilst keeping the syntax of the system that people actually write in the same more or less. Obviously if there is some major revolution in either HTML or LaTeX some additional syntax would be needed. As a note there has not been a major revolution in the type is handled in either system since their incarnations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since I am bothering with minutiae rather than my more abstract self let me get this off my chest: Footnotes and Hyperlinks are conceptually the same. Stop using both unless the material can not be hyperlinked for whatever silly reason and even then have the hyperlink lead to an endnote page.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;logic&quot;&gt;Logic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logic as a course is just there to add some value to the rest of the curriculum. I actually don’t really understand why simple Aristotelian Logic is not taught to children since it would obviously help with simple mathematics and even Euclidean Geometry. Beyond that it would help with computer programming and even would be more beneficial towards learning rhetoric. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We live in a world with logical machines, if not people, it may be wise to at least make some type of introduction to the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-knowledge-phase&quot;&gt;The Knowledge Phase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would be a more formal, as in learning the forms, step in the path of most students. This should be treated more or less as an equivalent of High School despite the fact there would be some bleeding into the strange zone of Middle School. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary goal of this period is to fill the students head with a great many facts. Nothing really more that. They do not need to understand the underlying form of inquiry as to how history functions but rather just some dates of and some statistically interesting events. At least as far as most countries nation building projects allow – I am being pragmatic here because in reality I care very little for what the nation building project yearns for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much the stage which the tutors will yet again become teachers. The main function would be to lecture with the exception of one particular educator that would remain in the role of custodian of a certain class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear though there is no need to have 1 or 2 hours lectures for younger children. A lecture could be scaled down to a 15 minute small lesson for early ideas in the subject but as the ideas get more advanced so do the lectures. This type of scaling can not only benefit younger students assumed ADD but it can also train the student to only say what is necessary rather than the standard verbal diarrhoea that occurs when trying to fulfil a word count. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would also be a need to schedule lectures so that any student in the school could attend the lecture that is of particular interest to their studies at any given moment; within certain limits of course. Essentially, you would have a lecture on, let’s say, mitosis once or twice a month from the various different people you have on staff that have the ability give such a lecture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a system would prevent boredom of the staff and also if a student simply can not get the idea from one teacher, due to some deficiency in the relationship, the student can pick up the idea from another teacher if not from the text books. Furthermore it teaches the ability to plan out ones time.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my mind, the ideal method to get through this is stage is somewhat like the Oxbridge system of Colleges with the exception that most schools would be local for such student of young and tender ages. I do not personally agree with this because I happen to be a boarding school brat and find that system far more useful if you actually want a child educated but people tell me that living with your parents during your teen years is beneficial. Just imagining such a situation makes me shudder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A ‘home room’ tutor would be assigned to monitor the students slightly and offer help with assignments when it is asked for. While educators with some sort of speciality knowledge could focus more on communicating the general knowledge that would be required for the assignments that are floating about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main advantages of such a system are really quite simple. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that the deauthorizing of knowledge from a singular source. This is an important lesson to learn which seems absent from the current system based on my observations of the behaviour of freshman students qua their professors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The behaviour I am alluding two comes in two contrary forms. There is the student that gets near to humping their professors leg in order to get the information they need to do well in the course and then the other form is just the student that ignores, this is the more popular type of freshmen, the professors office hours completely and but all trust into the chosen text book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am willing to bet that each form of student is developed based of the perceived quality of their teachers during secondary education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially it is better to authorize the multitude of voices so that research comes second nature latter is far more useful to the universities than either of what the schools seem to be producing today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other benefit is that, like before, if a student excels at one of their assignments then they can be rewarded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example of this would be an assignment that asks, this would be physics, “An 1 gram fly is going toward a 5000 kilogram truck travelling at 100 kilometers per hour. How fast does the fly need to travel to stop the truck, assuming the fly does not simply go through the truck?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the surface this question tests two minor abilities in the field of physics. How to deal with SI units and simple inelastic collisions. A correct answer would yield full points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a bit of a trick here. If you were to bother to work out the speed the fly would have to be travelling the fly is going fast enough to be easier represented in a fraction of light speed. With that in mind, relativistic effects start to rear its ugly head and it turns out the speed of the fly needs to be a little lower because it has gained mass along the way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a student is not expected to know this when doing such a simple question in physics but if for some strange reason they do why not award the student with a completed assignment in their relativistic physics rotation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current system, at the fiat of the teacher, we may award a few bonus points but this is incorrect. Demonstrating such knowledge just shows the knowledge in relativistic physics not all physics so awarding implied points to optics would be at least fraudulent. Even then there is the possibility that relativistic physics is not part of the curriculum so awarding points at all is not just at least fraudulent but criminally unprincipled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I guess the jackass that figures out how many calories the fly would have to consume and burn should get some points for their biology rotation although they should be reminded that it was not part of the question unless it has some impact, pardon the pun, on how much the fly weighs or is travelling; I was never very good at biology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the fact of rewarding the acquisition of knowledge for its own sake and the ability to know when to use it, this system would also allow for students to actually think in interdisciplinary ways, which is quite the buzz word fluttering about grant committees. Also there is a way to get over the axiomatic problems that are presented in by taking on a discipline as your life work but I have found that most academics are more interested in grant proposals rather than furthering their field in any significant way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-thinking-phase&quot;&gt;The Thinking Phase&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this what university should be like, with the exception of professional schools, like medicine for obvious reasons. This phase should be simply what grad school looks like. Small seminar type classes and attempting to apprentice future academics properly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really have much to say about this phase because part of thinking is allowing others to think and in this case the apprenticeship it would be best be left to the professors to figure out how to train their students at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will actually bring meaning back to the saying I studied under so-and-so for undergrads instead of the now familiar ‘I was supervised by what’s-his-face’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-revolution-is-here&quot;&gt;The Revolution Is Here&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to reiterate that these are merely suggestions on how to design a system based on my observations. I could have missed something or I could simply be wrong. I don’t believe that I am wrong but if an argument is made to the contrary point of something I wrote then I will think on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point of this article is that the education system is quite simply failing to address the age in which we live and what is really going on. Students are miserable and I have met people that claim to speak fluent English and can’t make heads or tails of Canterbury Tales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will finish this as I started it, with a video. This time it will be Sir Ken Robinson pleading for people to listen to the need for change. If I have left you unconvinced of my system please heed his call and let us start changing the way we become.  &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Recently I learnt that the Duke Nukem apparently ended up in the black despite the fact that every critic on Earth panned it for good reason. This lead to the obvious depression that ‘Gamers’ were obviously a bunch of porridge brained idiots that can easily amused by jingling your keys in front of the as long as you keychain had a scantly clad woman on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I logged into to Google Plus and the top post in my feed, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sexyvideogameland.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Leigh Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, linked me to this wonderful video for the recent Valve contest. In short, this has restored my faith that some, although a very small group, of gamers actually care about art. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>It's The Journey, Not The Destination</title>

   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;After using Google + for a few weeks and fiddling with Facebook for an about the same amount of time I decided to access the two social services. To that end and despite the superficial similarity between Facebook and Google + there is deep undercurrents in the way they are handling their users. This is merely caused by their respective genesises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook started off a digital equivalent of a regular old facebook. For those of you not familiar all a Facebook is the picture book version of a who’s who. And in all fairness the digital equivalent is still pretty much just that. You have a page, and others, can update so there is an increasing numbers of published iterations. Thus you keep checking the page to see the latest iteration of your published self. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fairly simple idea but with certain consequences when there is an attempt to monetize the concept. Because the only product is you and your behaviour &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; the ‘book’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the ads are so terrible and all over the place in Facebook but it is also why they have this peculiar habit of replicating and/or absorbing a great deal of the web. &lt;a href=&quot;http://theoatmeal.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article-images/facebook-oatmeal.png&quot; alt=&quot;This image is unrealistic. He is not wearing a hoodie.&quot; class=&quot;floatright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Which is fine, in its way, but it gets annoying when you are trying to link in and out of facebook quickly. I understand that it is not in Facebook’s interest to allow to jump in and out of their island at will - that might negatively effect their ad revenue - but it is still mildly annoying if you use the internet outside facebook. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s it isn’t it. Facebook just doesn’t feel like the rest of the web. It feels like its own little internalized application that has its own set of rules. Some what like a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet&quot;&gt;usenet&lt;/a&gt; of this decade. Which would be great if it didn’t have all the constraints of having to work from within a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google, on the other hand, started off, and continues to be, a search engine. They are the defacto mass transit system for the internet as a whole and it is in their interest to shuffle you around the internet as quickly as possible. Otherwise, in their head space, at least you would just jump ship to another service like Bing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why Google attempts to get you from your search to the page you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as quickly as possible even if that means you are not exposed to as many ads. The fact that the search bar is in pretty much every respectable browser shows you that much. Furthermore if an advertisement obfuscates the desired link of the user Google would be a less successful search engine. Which in turn would hurt their ability to sell ads in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The have also been crafty enough to launch an easy to use ad network so that even when you leave googles direct properties they can still sell ads. So content being developed outside their own efforts becomes utilized by their services. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google walks a fine tightrope in order to keep their users, which are their products after all, and their clients happy. Consider it like free range farming; You get to run around where ever you please but no matter what you still get the chop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook would be more like factory farming. Keeping you in a very specific spot and only that spot and it is important that you are only feed what Facebook tells you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, at least for Google, is that Facebook is a walled garden away from Google’s long reach. Since Facebook seems unwilling to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/itunes/ping/&quot;&gt;play ball with other major players&lt;/a&gt;, except &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/Skype&quot;&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt;, Google + was born so that Google can compete.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google + is an attempt to bring their free range farming tactics to the social internet age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, A google + hangout has a specific url which makes it its own location for the browser. In the physical world this would be like having the coffee shop to meet up at and there is no wall to make posts on because that would be an extra click and that might annoy users. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, Google + can just absorb apps as google comes up with them, much as the top bar in the search engine did. Facebook, on the other hand is getting continuously more cluttered and their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/Skype&quot;&gt;most recent attempt to to stay relevant&lt;/a&gt; has all the relevancy of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS&quot;&gt;VHS tape&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means to the end user is just that Google + is an attempt by Google to make something that is better than Facebook and with only that goal in mind, with their background in linking, it has the possibility to be the defacto &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;internet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; social medium. Google is just trying to make your ‘friends’ part of you ferrying about the internet.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you do not want to use the internet and would prefer to hangout in Facebook all day long their is little to entice you out of the monolithic app unless Google manages to absorb users time to such an extent that it becomes impossible to maintain both profiles. I doubt this will happen anytime soon though given that many seem to have time for both. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Abebe Bikila, All Too Human</title>
   <link href="/2011/07/18/abebe-bikila-all-too-human/"/>
   <updated>2011-07-18T14:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/07/18/abebe-bikila-all-too-human</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I began to change the way I run. I debated this for about a year, when I started running, but finally I decided to take the plunge and start running barefoot-ish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason it took so long is because I have the unfortunate Greek problem of having an index toe, also known as a Morton’s toe. This coupled with the fact that I only had one running related injury over the course of my running life I did not feel any immediacy towards getting any form of barefoot shoe. Then one rainy day I did a Jerry Lewis prat fall on the street near &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pointpleasantpark.ca/&quot;&gt;Point Pleasant Park&lt;/a&gt;. Lying in the mud and looking at the grey ceiling I decided it was time for something new; or at least something with new treads.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked at both the &lt;a href=&quot;http://lunasandals.com/&quot;&gt;Luna sandals&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/&quot;&gt;Vibram Five Fingers&lt;/a&gt; and decided to go with the Vibram model first. My rational behind this is that the Bikila LS model is a combination of what would seem to be natural with the impression that there was some modern Science! involved. I am sure there was very little actual science going on, you know with lab coats, but I like the impression that it is going on in the background. &lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/GLaDOS&quot;&gt;A passive agressive homicidal AI&lt;/a&gt; would also be a plus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was another reason, beyond the Science!, but there is a certain romance to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abebe_Bikila&quot;&gt;late night run of Abebe Bikila&lt;/a&gt; that appeals to me. So what is my experience of running around Halifax? Is it as magical as that Roman sunset outside the Colosseum in 1960. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest I started too fast and started experiencing weird side effects due to the new demands on the system. My calves started hurting due to the extra 2 cm drop they had to accommodate. Then the muscles in charge of impact resistance started to ache in a whole new way and I had developed a rather odd, and none too faltering, walking stride whilst walking around town.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, basically after the first week, the pain started to vanish and I started to run like a normal person again. At least from the hips up. My stride had changed fundamentally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside of all of this is that I started to enjoy running on the grass, like when I was a child all those years ago, and even running on the rounded stone beaches of Point Pleasant Park. I pretty much like running on all surfaces now whereas before I tended to stay on the cement or beaten in ground. Essentially because the texture of the ground now translated through the shoe I ceased to simply pound the poor things into the ground and started to touch it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I said my runs are not magical is because they are not. I now know how the trick is done. Halifax, with all the mistakes and successes of years of city planers, has become part of my sense memory now. The feel of the ocean breeze as run across a stone beach. The texture of the hills of Point Pleasant after a summer rain. The feel of cement slabs that are ever so slightly misaligned and which curbs are wheel chair friendly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality of Halifax is seeping through up through my feet and I imagine the Bikila thought much the same of Rome. It is not a magical feeling that you feel at the end of your run. It is merely a human feeling. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Oh You're Sure To Do That If You Only Walk Long Enough</title>

   &lt;p&gt;There are not many bands that vex me. There is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beautifulsmallmachines.com/&quot;&gt;Beautiful Small Machines&lt;/a&gt; with the ultimate geeky cheerfulness that is a serious competitor against &lt;em&gt;Carebears&lt;/em&gt; for sheer nauseating cuteness. Then there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://anamanaguchi.com/&quot;&gt;Anamanaguchi&lt;/a&gt; making yearn for my misspent youth of warm summer days spent hiding indoors in front of 8-bit friends. And finally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/pages/SoHo-Ghetto/113119555373787&quot;&gt;The SoHo Ghetto&lt;/a&gt; (née Marc-Antoine and The Soho Ghetto) which is a local band in Halifax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these bands have something in common, beyond the fact that they vex me. They have yet to push a full album and do not release new material all that often. Which is mildly maddening due to the fact that each one of these bands is on my weekly playlist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not often discuss music except with a select few and even then sparingly. The reason for this is simply because I agree that writing, or speaking about music, is as bewildering as dancing about architecture. Still I must make an exception because this morning while I was spending some time decompressing my thoughts on SoHo Ghetto’s new single a thought occurred to me as to why I love them quite so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, while trying to watch the ceiling fan while lying on my floor I put on the Anchor Tattoo single&lt;a href=&quot;http://sohoghetto.bandcamp.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article-images/anchor-tattoo.png&quot; alt=&quot;Anchor Tattoo&quot; class=&quot;floatleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on at a pleasant background volume. This is when I started to focus on the song I began to think about my own little life and the little smile, that I sometimes carry, crept over my face. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All my memories that are from my vagrancy period started to flash by to the tempo of the tune. My own little music video. A few of the greater loves of my life and many of the lesser. All the smiles, the running, the eating, the kissing, and even some of the more pornographic moments. Now obviously based on the song the memories evoked were all the pleasant coming and goings that I managed to finagle from life but to anyone that listening to the song there is no real bitterness to it. Just a feeling of complacent joy despite the occasional ‘desperate waiting’. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then decided to review the Parisian EP &lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article-images/parisian_ep.png&quot; alt=&quot;Parisian EP&quot; class=&quot;floatright&quot; /&gt; just to see if the same feel was there. It is but of a slightly different flavour. Maybe the wounds are still a little fresh to truly be nostalgia but also maybe there is something to be said for additional players and the added femininity of Rachel Sunter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did get this EP way the hell back in January 2010. Marc-Antoine then spoke, during a couple of the patter sections of the show, about being down and out in Paris. And like many young men in Europe, including myself, when the land of modern fairy tales confront the cruelty of reality we become somehow different. Wiser but in a unique way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to think that this is for the better. I would like to think that these lost creatures of Europe live in a perpetual wake for their former selves and take on a purposeful smile and can even laugh at the heart ache. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would seem that the music of the SoHo ghetto is like the smile of the chesire cat. Something delightful that stays long after their lines are sung.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>No, I think it is</title>

   &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;On the rioting in Athens: “what was happening in the square in front of Parliament for weeks and weeks was a perfectly peaceful demonstration that people were taking their children to,” he said. “People were there with their grandparents and their children, it was a family occasion and totally peaceful. And it was making our points. And then for just two days, the new ones showed up and started throwing bricks and rocks. It’s disgraced the country. It’s embarrassing. It’s not Greece.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I hate being contradictory, wait I love it but that is beside the point, this is exactly what Greece does every time they get upset. I don’t even have to rely on my classical study of the area just look what happened less than 50 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigh, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_military_junta_of_1967–1974&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I understand the it was just the words of a cabbie but having spent a little to much time in the backs of Athenian cabs I shall let the Globe and Mail in on a little secret. Nearly all Cabbies in Athens are crazy. So please don’t print the words of crazy people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And further more try not to relate Canada’s problems to Greece’s. Greek federal politics has been corrupt since the absence of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Papandreou&quot;&gt;Papandreou the first&lt;/a&gt;. Not fake sponsorship scandal corruption but real corruption - similar to municipal corruption in Canada to give you an idea. Vancouver lost a hockey game on the other hand and the G8 thing happened once and for a particular reason. The Greeks are merely rioting because they don’t like what is happening and think they have no other recourse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to internationally relate all these things look into the jobless and underemployed rates of highly educated and physically fit 20 somethings that have a bit of idyll time on their hands because the of the sequestered capital being held for baby boomer retirement. &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;I have been complaining about Microsoft’s slavish devotion to their previous UI decisions for at least 6 years but after seeing this I finally think that Microsoft may have a winner on their hands. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is assuming they can get &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(layout_engine)&quot; title=&quot;IE's layout engine&quot;&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt; and 3rd party developers and hardware manufactures on board.  &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lies, Damn Lies, and Press Releases</title>
   <link href="/2011/05/19/lies-damn-lies-and-press-releases/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-19T18:00:00-03:00</updated>

   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;I follow a great many highly intelligent people on twitter. Which is why I am surprised that no one seems to be questioning the Amazon press release about how they are selling more Kindle books than they are printed books. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically speaking no one is lying outright but the press release is giving a false impression. Amazon always uses the Amazon.com sales numbers to quantify results and it very clearly says that Amazon.com is selling more Kindle editions than other formats. Which is probably to give the impression that dead tree variety of book is falling wayside. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst this is probably true, I am not the trusting sort, there is no mention how many of those sales are from foreign consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that don’t know the Kindle store, with the exception of the UK version, is actually an international store. As a Canadian I would be buying my books from Amazon.com and not Amazon.ca and I having seen a few Kindles floating about the wilds of Halifax I assume this is the case with other Canadians as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So essentially Amazon.com has absorbed a much larger market of all non-british English readers which is a population of about 1 billion as opposed to Amazon.com’s dead tree market which maxes out at approximately 330 million. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the Kindle format was reaching true dominance it should be much higher than a slightly higher than one to one ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Civilized Diet</title>
   <link href="/2011/05/17/the-civilized-diet/"/>

   &lt;p&gt;It seems that spring has finally sprung in this northern environment. There are various way to tell and when this happening. The shoes become less boot like, the guys with large calf muscle tattoos no longer shiver as much when they are wearing their shorts, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.halifaxpublicgardens.ca/&quot; title=&quot;The Halifax Public Gardens&quot;&gt;the Public Gardens&lt;/a&gt; opens, and the stuff that falls from the sky becomes more wet and less white. It’s all very unhygienic if you ask me but these signs are what anyone can see. There is one new symptom of springyness which I was not aware of until this year. The people in your life stop making fun out of your dietary quirks and start seriously sitting you down and asking pointed questions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This does not happen to everyone but it has been happening to me quite a lot lately. I guess it’s because I have lost a great deal of excess fat tissue, quit smoking, and generally look healthier than I have in years.I guess the other symptom is the vague hope that one day in the near future there is a slim chance that clouds will part and there may be a chance of a trip to the beach. This is immediately followed by the terror of displaying all those unsightly folds in the body. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as I have done &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldoftomorrow.ca/2011/01/14/the-endless-nightmare-from-which-i-can-not-wake-gay-marriage-edition/&quot; title=&quot;Gay Marriage&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; I will write it down so I do not have to repeat myself ad infinitum et naseaum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I may bore you at some latter date about how I arrived at all these little decisions and all the mistakes I made along the way but let me spoil the ending since that is what people keep asking me about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wtf-are-you-eating&quot;&gt;WTF are you eating?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is more or less the question I get asked globally except the older people in my life may word it a bit differently. The answer they want is always looking for some magic bullet, or possibly a flute, to my diet. Basically ‘What thing can I start eating to look like you?’ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My eye roll is usually audible when I figure out that is the question in the other persons mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let me answer once and for all:  &lt;em&gt;there is no magical thing that you can eat that will solve all your problems&lt;/em&gt;. If anyone says different they are selling you something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can, however, alter a bunch of things in your life to be healthier and happier. There are a great many diets out there that claim to do just that and have the added marketing bonus of having famous people on them. So I am going to start with the diet schemas that you will find as you search through the internet and explain exactly why I am not on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;palaeo-diet-why-do-so-many-people-spell-it-paleo&quot;&gt;Palaeo Diet: Why Do So Many People Spell It Paleo?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came upon this diet through &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/danbenjamin&quot; title=&quot;Twitter&quot;&gt;Dan Benjamin&lt;/a&gt; when I was idly listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/dailyedition/11&quot;&gt;the Daily Edition&lt;/a&gt; one afternoon. Even during the show I thought there were obvious logical problems with what was being said but that was only the rationale behind the diet. Still I was surprised at that fact there were a great many acti rei that I was already doing. So in interest of fairness let me start there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general if you switch from a standard, unthinking, North American diet to the Palaeo diet you will notice a definite health boost. The reason for why this is has nothing to do with modernity really but I has more to with how capitalism functions coupled with a few farm subsidies but that is a boring long topic that I do not wish to get into at this juncture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially I like that they eat animals that are, under normal circumstances, raised ethically and that they eat large quantities of vegetables. Eating less sugar and grain has obvious health benefits and the diet explicitly advocates exercise that you find fun along with the concept of actually leaving your house and doing these things in a group setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So great, fantastic in fact. Everybody should be on this diet right. Well as you noticed what I am naming my diet, in a tongue in the cheek way, is mocking this particular brand of cult diet so there must be something wrong with it. Well it is not just something but the entire diet is built on foundation of sand. &lt;em&gt;All of the quotes below are me paraphrasing a variety of sources.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a more natural diet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bullshit&quot;&gt;Bullshit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nature is, by its very definition, what is outside of humanity. I know lots of people, including Trudeau, want to be a child of nature but if we are children of nature we have most definitely moved out of the house long ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Well by natural we mean what we ate during the Palaeolithic period when we where healthier due to our diet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bullshit-1&quot;&gt;Bullshit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took physical anthropology as well. Child mortality rates were through the roof at the time and that messes with the over all health gauge that you apply to the adult population. Basically anyone with any disease that would make life without assistance would die very early on in their lives. Our medical technology has made a lot of terminal childhood aliments became chronic adult ailments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, our first world jobs that have us sitting for the great majority of our lives has nothing to do with the amount of physical activity that would have been required to gather food in the any lithic period. Unless you are in some sort of profession that requires a particularly high energy input it is most likely your calories in versus calorie out does not match or Cro-Magnon predecessors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes but grain is poison. We haven’t evolved to eat it yet and it makes some people very sick. It’s science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bullshit-2&quot;&gt;Bullshit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never use the sick to bolster your argument. It makes you look like a tv evangelist and besides that very small subset of people are critically affected by grain while some are just mildly bother by it. It’s kind of like lactose intol…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dairy is also going to jump out the little dairy thing in your fridge and kill you in your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;sigh&quot;&gt;Sigh.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where was I? Oh right its kind of like lactose intolerance. There is a bit of a bell curve to those that are ethnically disposed to eating the stuff. Sure grain was a more global change in eating behaviour but that is only because it is that much more useful than dairy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for evolution I am pretty sure you don’t really seem to understand the theory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When watching a discovery channel special about evolution you get the idea that evolution is the change in species over a very long period of time. The Tyrannosaurus Rex morphing slowly into chicken and ostriches and what not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is true and it is also true that we have not physically changed that much over the course of the last 100.000 or so years. It is not true that our ability to digest certain types of food has not changed drastically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few reason for this but let’s start with evolution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evolution is not the slow changes of species over time. That is the observed effect. Evolution is more the theory that one species can become a totally different species with there is a environmental stimulus that effects survival. Considering there was a huge population explosion of all species concerned at the end of the last Ice Age I would like to suggest that for the vast majority of the population seems to be benefiting form the new found environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice I said species. Humans are only on side of the equation here. The grain itself has changed as well. Normally we were just trying to increase yield of flour per stalk in the given farm land but the grain that occupies most of our farming efforts has nothing to do with the wild things we were dealing with in the early stages of our urbanisation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, even based merely on the math, we all share a single descendant from the last thousand years or so and that is after around 8.000 years of pretty stable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… but grain is evil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grain is merely a type of chemical fuel to keep us alive. It might not be the best fuel for our current lifestyle but in the history of mistakes &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; made one mistake for over 5.000 years. In fact very few things has stayed as consistant habit for such a long period other than the basic components of our diet. So let’s go at his at a different angle. Why are those that eat grain the ones that inherited the earth? (Remember grain being a staple of a diet only started in the river valleys of the Yanzhi, Ganges, Tigris and Euphrates, and the Nile.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously think about it. This a technology that has 100 percent of the market. Even Ipods are less ubiquitous than grain. ‘Let them eat bread’. The communion ritual. ‘Bread and Circuses’. Passover. ‘7 cities now claim Homer dead through which he begged [for] his bread’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As much as the glowing Apple logo is symbol for ‘I’m creating’, grain is the symbol for what it is to be civilized. Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just two reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is simple. Grain can be stored for long periods without rotting. Ancient societies had some difficulty with the refrigeration concept. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reason is that, even though it not the most nutritious thing on earth, it is very good at replacing glycogen. Just ask any endurance athlete. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an important reason really because when grain was the major chemical fuel that ran our society it was a great solution. Especially when most of the physical labour put into building and maintaining these society was human in essence(re. slavery).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these reasons are becoming increasing obsolete. We have replaced slave labour with largely hydrocarbon fuelled machines and I think we have the whole flash freezing and consistant electrical power thing down despite the occasional hiccup. Think about how ballsy it is to make ice cream and then ship it hundreds if not thousands of kilometers away to just have sit on shelf. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the reason Palaeo people site but at the same time they advocate no grain when the increased obsolesces of grain is merely of an argument that, perhaps, we should eat &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; grain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But SCIENCE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh you’re still there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right science and this applies to all scientific data on human nutrition; there is no definite data on human nutrition. There is data that suggests things but it is hardly gospel and we have seen how inaccurate those texts are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people may quote some specific biochemical reaction in the body or some minor study that about a specific food given to an incredulously small sample group and claim it is science when in reality is scientific. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look at the original paper there are a lot of ‘perhaps’, ‘tends’, and ‘maybes’ dominating the word count. This is also the problem with scientists these days not being proud of their work to the point of being obnoxious which annoys me for other reasons but a different day and a different topic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go back into you those dark recesses of your mind. Remember sitting in that middle school general science class where someone was trying to introduce you to the clever mix of inductive and deductive logic that we call the scientific method. What was the most important thing to get rid of? Unknown quantities. Otherwise your experiment is bunk, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now try to reduce the amount of influence of unknown quantities on your research data on human health as it relates to a diet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get rid of the ethnic variability you would need a large enough sample group say about somewhere between one hundred thousand to one million. Then there is the environmental variable so you would have to spread everyone out so that they were living in every possible environment on this earth. Also since we want to tell people how to eat for their whole life you would need data from every stage of human development. Then just to make sure you would probably need at least 2 or 3 generations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the experiment would take approximately a century and cost a ridiculous sum of money but it would produce decent enough data. Until someone presents you with such data they are fumbling about in the dark like so many horny teenagers before them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I am pretty sure some people at the Hague might want to have a chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But you will lose weight and gain muscle and …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, all diets claim that. It’s a standard claim and honestly thats what gets most people through the door. This is the major part of any diet that is internalized to the point of narcissism. You are not building a community if you are only talking about your nutrition, or your looks, or your how other food, that other people are eating, is going to kill you and your family then its time to pack it in as far as I am concerned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it another way &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug&quot;&gt;Norman Borlaug&lt;/a&gt; saved humanity from starving to death and not only is Palaeo diet’s greatest achievement that you might get six pack abs one summer but you have they have audacity to imply that poor old Norman is a mass poisoner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that I have to stop talking about Palaeo before I get angry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;veganism&quot;&gt;Veganism&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oddly, for the fact that it most disimular to my own diet, I have less problems with Veganism. As a group they somewhat annoy me but only in a mild way. This is probably because they, as group, are outward thinking. Most vegans I meet don’t want to be the cause of suffering unto this earth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the annoying part comes in. It is not really their fault. It is more a byproduct of early liberal romanticism about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How all creature great and small are yearning to be free and that nature is oh so wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;bullshit-3&quot;&gt;Bullshit&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay I am just being mean, and more problematically - redundant, for the sake of consistency so I will cut it out now. The whole idea of veganism is just born out of the general coddling of modern world coupled with the ability to use mental blinders to information around them. Which is probably why I can not entertain the idea of veganism for very long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key misfire that needs to be addressed is that death does not equal suffering. In fact in some cases it is the release to suffering but that is a topic for another day. Suffering is the only thing that equals suffering and let me explain the difference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happen to live in a city. In some point in the near future, if I am to believe some of the science fiction stories floating about, there will be a point where animal life is completely wiped out and the only animals that will be left in the cities will be man. In the interm I have noticed that there are quite a few pigeons floating about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They got there because at some point, I think in the mid 17th century, the squab market’s bottom fell out and the farmers just kind of let the beasties go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since these are a mostly domesticated animal they have a rapid growth cycle and are always able to breed as long as food is around. With these talents at their disposal they managed to carve out a niché in urban centers. And now people complain about them and consider them pests. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I ask have any of you really looked at one of these animals closely or do you just kick them out of you way? I have and I can tell you I do not like what I see. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not long ago, I saw a pigeon that was little more hagard than the rest. Upon closer scrutiny it seemed to have misplaced its foot and was attempting to walk on an obviously sore stump. Upon even closer inspection, yes I had to move my head closer to the birds for this one, I noticed that the stump had not quite healed properly and with each step some puss was coming out of the side of its leg each time the stump hit the ground. I tried to throw a small amount of food closer to it than the others with middling success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not earth shattering to me nor should it be to anyone else but I shudder at the possibility of the a large scale sudden change to veganism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just imagine what I just described on the scale of all our domestic animals. I am sure some of you may think that these large farm conglomerates will simply kill all the animals, which kind of ignores the first principles of veganism anyway, but the last time I checked factory farms do not care that much about the sake of the environment or the for the sake of the people in their direct vicinity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they do care about is their bottom line. So if all the meat markets collapsed and there is little to no chance that any of the individual animals could be traced back to a particle institution, what do you think they will do? Kill all the animals at their own expense and dispose of the bodies both hygienically and properly or just open the doors and let them out? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still Veganism is possible as a personal choice even if building a large scale community out of the diet is probably not the best idea.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wtf-i-am-eating&quot;&gt;WTF I Am Eating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that I must make absolutely clear is that this diet is less about what you are putting into your body and is really about how you get the things towards your body in the first place. This is largely ignored by most ‘diets’ which doesn’t make a great deal of sense to me. Food is part of our lives in a more important way than just the base material of what we massage over a gullets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can you eat on this diet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, pretty much anything really but the general rule is: If the food you want to eat has a marketing department, especially if it a health based marketing campaign, then you probably shouldn’t eat it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My more complicated rules follow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;animal-treatment&quot;&gt;Animal Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dostoevsky tells me that you can judge any society by the treatment of their prisoners. AS far as I am concerned that statement should be altered to say that ‘every society should be judged by the treatment of those in their custody’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, we overtly support an industry that essentially tortures animals for the entirety of their short lives to save a couple of bucks a week. Which then most of us turn around and spend it on something trivial; like a video game. I know its a couple of buck a week because I am paying exactly 3 dollars more a week on meat than I used to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be a byproduct of growing up with a mother that was a fan of James Harriot but to be fair I like animals, in general, and I have no inclination, desire, or need to cause undue suffering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course there are a great many studies showing that animals that are farmed traditionally are better for a great many reasons and in all likely hood just changing your meat supply to the traditionally farmed equivalents will probably make you loose weight. Also it tastes a great deal better (Actually I do not notice as huge a difference with chicken as the difference in beef and pork from their mass produced counterparts). Still, I don’t want to believe that most people will care more about their waist lines over the welfare of millions of living creatures. I choose to believe that most people just feel like the can’t do anything about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But honestly ask yourself is new ipod once a year worth the cost of the wonton suffering that you are creating on this earth? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wild-animals&quot;&gt;Wild Animals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally I do not eat any wild animals because I think it’s rude. We do not raise these creatures and with our invention of agriculture we should be able able to avoid killing random animals for food. This is merely a personal convention and it is debatable in a causal non-yelling way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An outgrowth of this idea, which I am more adamant about, is that I do not eat fish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not that I do not enjoy the taste and it goes beyond the simple rudeness factor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The real reason behind this is that when science is seriously asking &lt;a href=&quot;http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/03/the-oceans-of-2050-will-there-be-any-fish-left.ars&quot;&gt;whether or not there will be &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; fish left in 2050&lt;/a&gt;, I think that laying of the fish sticks for a few years might be a good idea. I occasionally get yelly about this one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;science&quot;&gt;Science&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite my rant about the faulty science in the Palaeo diet, I actually am a big fan of the higher ideals of science. I would like to think that scientists are, in general, trying to make the world of better place. I also acknowledge in pursuit of this that mistakes will be made. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this I have tendency, from time to time, to do the one month experiment of adding or taking away things from my daily diet based on some papers that are being circulated.  To this end I have reduced the amont of grain I eat, one or two servings a day, but there are two unusual items in my diet that I should note. So breakfast for me is a bowl of fruit or a smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds and a supplement called &lt;a href=&quot;http://myvega.com/products/whole-food-health-optimizer/features-benefits&quot;&gt;Vega&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chia seeds I just eat because they have omega-3 fats and it seems to be a decent fish replacement. I just dump two tables spoons in my juice before my morning run. It is not a huge deal and it did help that it is both cheap, 13 dollars a month, and was food stuff that was used for a particularly long period of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Vega, on the other hand, is a new thing with a few things that are not necessarily traditional food in it. I don’t think microplankton is food at all by most definitions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brendanbrazier.com/&quot;&gt;Brendan Brazier&lt;/a&gt; did formulate it and used it given the unreasonable demands he put on his body – he is an Iron Man triathelte – and it seemed to work well for him so I thought I would try the one month thing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started taking it when I started my first attempt to run a marathon, post smoking, and I found that it did help a great deal. In general it makes me feel more energetic and it seems to be quite good for me which I can fairly accurately diagnosis but don’t want to get into how I know these things. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still I go of it from time to time because it is quite expensive and it is not exactly food. I consider the modern equivalent of taking your cod liver oil and unless you have some severe restrictions on your diet it is not necessary. Just a nice bonus if you can afford it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;exercise&quot;&gt;Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do something you &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; for a few times a week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thats all I have to say on that. Just try to do something that makes you move under your own power for 30 mins or so. I personally do more but I happen to like running and I lift weights a few times a week because the running was making me far to thin but just pick something that you like to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are terribly out of shape you may have to wait of month for you not to hate all physical activity. After that though you should know if you like it or not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;buy-from-small-vendors&quot;&gt;Buy from Small Vendors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you buy your foods from small vendors, which essentially all non-factory farms are, then you have a great deal more power than you have over the larger corporate entities. A small group will notice when your business is gone and furthermore they appreciate the business they get. They simply put the extra effort forth where as large business simply race to the bottom on price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, beyond simple power negotiations, you feel better about yourself. Not in the ‘oh look at me buying local’ sense – I hate that – but in the sense that you start to care about the health of the people you deal with.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, I buy all of my beef and most of my pork from Chris de Waal from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getawayfarm.ca&quot; title=&quot;Getaway Farms&quot;&gt;Getaway farm&lt;/a&gt;. He knows that I have an unhealthy obsession with well marbleized rib eye steaks but I also know when he is off giving a lecture and I find myself wondering how it went, if I did not attend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tea guy, despite the fact of the impossibility of tea being grown locally, Philip Holmans of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldteahouse.ca&quot; title=&quot;World Tea House&quot;&gt;World Tea House&lt;/a&gt; knows far to much about me but at the same time I think it is the only tea house on earth where I can talk about tea, video games, and zombies. He also has the ability to recommend tea to me after figuring out what my general tastes are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get coffee from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theuncommongroup.com/&quot; title=&quot;Uncommon Group&quot;&gt;Uncommon Grounds&lt;/a&gt; and I know most of the staff there although they have a tough time knowing what type of coffee I am in the mood for due to my mercurial nature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I want a baked good I don’t go and buy a box of oreos. I either get something at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theuncommongroup.com/&quot; title=&quot;Uncommon Group&quot;&gt;Uncommon Grounds&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.susiesshortbreads.com/&quot; title=&quot;Cupcake Land&quot;&gt;Susie’s Shortbread&lt;/a&gt;. I personally find that any one item for either of those places if far more pleasurable that a whole box of pre-made cookies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this list goes on and on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what the real civil part of the diet. You have to build an actual community from which you can actually get to know people and this allows you to actually have a personal relationship with your food and also enforce a certain sensibility across a great many businesses in your community. We have to be Patrons of our own community and in that sense you can feel the sense of pride and happiness of a parent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-all-is-said-and-done-life-is-just-to-damn-short&quot;&gt;When All Is Said and Done: Life Is Just to Damn Short&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the rules above can easily be disregarded in favour of your own. Seriously, don’t consider it a cheat this is how you live your life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your weight is bothering you then just cut the obviously bad things out of your diet and exercise a little but I should remind you that weight isn’t everything. People go on diets because something about their lives is wrong and they would like to fix it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking the goal of every dieter is to be happy again and I would tell some story from my life but it is easier to just retell an older story. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha&quot; title=&quot;The Buddha&quot;&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/a&gt;, during his one grain of rice a day phase, was approached by a girl with some rice pudding. The girl, seeing only a hungry man, offered him some. He did not say that grain was the poison of society, worry about the ingredients, or think about the calories. He just laughed, accepted some, and started down his path to true enlightenment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interacting with others is far more important that anything you eat. So go out and try to replace most of your food with food from people that you know and you like and remember it is always better to break bread with friends than it is to troll some Palaeo forum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know anybody well no is the time to make new friends and please, try to laugh occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Another Thoughtless Apple Prediction: Ipod Shuffle We Hardly Knew Yee</title>
   <link href="/2011/05/05/another-thoughtless-apple-prediction-ipod-shuffle-we-hardly-knew-yee/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-05T18:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/05/05/another-thoughtless-apple-prediction-ipod-shuffle-we-hardly-knew-yee</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;Since it is very much in vogue to make hasty Apple claims, I believe Gruber refers to this as claim chowder, I thought I would throw my hat into the ring. This is mainly so that I can point to a time stamped page and say I was right or hang my head in shame. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So as the title suggest I think that in the next refresh the Ipod Shuffle is going to removed from the product line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have come to this via the following logic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple has invested heavy marketing time into their touch interface persona and they are also making a variety of devices that all use the touch gesture based interface in one way or another with the exception of three products: The Ipod classic, Ipod Shuffle, and the Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the Apple TV is meant to be remotely used and even then it can be controlled with an IOS device so I don’t think that is going to be getting its own track pad or anything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ipod Classic still has a market, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/blankbaby/status/63310902627287040&quot;&gt;apparently&lt;/a&gt;, and I am guessing that it will continue to have a market until the price of solid state gets under memory startes getting under the 1 dollar per gigabyte range. Until then I figure it will be treated something like the Mac Pro. Something off in a corner for those that want it but rarely in the spotlight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ipod Shuffle’s, on the other hand, only advantage is that it is small and it occupies the sub-100 dollar mp3 player range. If they strip out the FM transmitter, reduce the space on the Nano, and given the screen interface relying technology is probably a bit cheaper now they be able to get the price in the sub-100 range. Which is more psychologically important than practical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would they do this? Simple, the touch interface is the new thing they are pushing and if they put it on their entry level device there is better chance of a Halo effect to their other devices. Beyond that when they make an advert for an Iphone or an Ipad they immediately make and advert for the cheaper device without have to make the effort. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Non Sequitur: Why Microsoft Should Buy RIM</title>
   <link href="/2011/05/05/non-sequitur-why-microsoft-should-buy-rim/"/>
   <updated>2011-05-05T15:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/05/05/non-sequitur-why-microsoft-should-buy-rim</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;I am beginning to think that logic has just fallen wayside despite the rise in university attendance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/05/05/microsoft-rim&quot;&gt;John Gruber&lt;/a&gt; has already beat me to the punch on why Microsoft &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; not buy RIM(Although I would like to remind people of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appleoutsider.com/2011/02/11/nokia/&quot;&gt;Nokia situation&lt;/a&gt;). I still think that Fabrice Taylor actually shows in this very article the reason why.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s problem is similar to RIM’s. It’s not exactly a hotbed of innovation. When is the last time it invented anything? It spent billions on music players, smart phones, the Xbox and other things, with results ranging from complete failure (in most cases) to questionable success in others (notably Xbox).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why would they buy a company that is having the same problems they are? What value does it add to Microsoft to buy this company? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[RIM]pretty much invented the smart phone and had the market all to itself for almost a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, but those days are over and RIM clearly ran out of ideas and the main reason to buy a company is because there will be future dividends. Although I grant that being able to break into the tablet market would be great for Microsoft the Playbook is not the best solution for them for a great many reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Both companies share an irksome problem called Apple … Apple spent $580-million on R&amp;amp;D in the most recent quarter, compared with RIM’s $380-million … [Microsoft]spent billions on music players, smart phones, the Xbox and other things, with results ranging from complete failure (in most cases) to questionable success in others (notably Xbox).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah I see. Well no it not the budget that is problem. It’s the approach and that is obvious given the fact that both Microsoft who has spent billions on R&amp;amp;D and RIM are having the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the the xbox has shown if you throw enough money at a problem it can be a solved but that only works as staling mechanism for long term growth of an already healthy company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference between Apple and the other two is their R&amp;amp;D works on a specific device through the eyes of human interaction with that device. Then Apple gains the research to put them into their other devices which then they learn more about interaction and the cycle continues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both RIM and Microsoft research the device. That works when you are the only kid on the block or you are throwing ridiculous amounts of money at it but it does not work for long term growth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the Zune failed, why the Playbook will have all these features but doesn’t have a good experience, why the original x-box had controllers designed for bears. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Microsoft needs to buy is a company that can build brand loyalty through relating with their customers. RIM might also want to have a think on what makes them special and work on that as well because if there is one thing Apple knows is what they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/ca/ipad/#ad&quot;&gt;good at&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;As many of my friends know I don’t particularly like Star Wars. I mock the prequels openly – I have yet to see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/&quot; title=&quot;Saw it in german&quot;&gt;second one in english&lt;/a&gt; actually – and even think the originals are that cinematically important. Sit me down with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041959/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Third Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a thousand times over any of the Star Wars films. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I have a secret. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my youth I was a bit of Star Wars fan and this is my story of that very first time I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;A New Hope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lisafoiles.com/&quot; title=&quot;Her Landing Page - Article is in the Title&quot;&gt;Lisa Foiles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had managed to avoid Star Wars for a great deal of my life. My mother was a Star Trek fan and thought all over science fiction was necessarily flawed for not being Star Trek. Not a big deal for kid honestly. In reality you just want something to make you smile and to even spend some time with your very busy parents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my younger years I watched all the Star Trek shows that I could with my mother and it seems to have served as a bit of bonding experience in my memory. Those may have been some of the better years of our relationship but, as most young people get, I became overly defensive of the Star Trek mythos simply because it was a defence of my mother. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, around the age of 12, I made a friend that calling him a huge Star Wars fan would not do him justice. We would fight about the merits of the two series without knowing the other side of argument. To his credit he started watching reruns of Star Trek: The Next Generation and started to grant that it had some merit. So out of deference to fairness I agreed to watch his THX remastered VHS collection some weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was blown away but the story and effects. This was world that had the type of graduer Disney stories but was a little more grown up but there were laser swords. I instantly became a fan in the way that a 12 year old can be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my history of being &lt;em&gt;Down and Out with George Lucas&lt;/em&gt; is not one that needs to be recounted today, or really ever, but I do have to admit that still after all this time when I hear the opening few bars of John Williams main theme a quick smile crosses my face. That is the smile of my 12 year old self with all the total and fevered happiness that innocence can bring. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that I am and always will be thankful for Star Wars because even after the miles I have put myself through it can still smile and feel like that 12 year old boy. Even if only for second. &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;This video perfectly encapsulates the feeling that I get around these sites in Greece after I became  familiar with the history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not mean as a tourist or, worse yet, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054198/&quot; title=&quot;Never on a Sunday&quot;&gt;Homer Thrace&lt;/a&gt; impersonator. It is not the awe of the site itself as some sort of relic of a former era but rather the feeling of camaraderie with something that is just obstinate enough to withstand the unsympathetic march of time.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>We Are Still Relevant</title>

   &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are two reasons for the decline, according to Nielsen. One is poverty: some low-income households no longer own TV sets, most likely because they cannot afford new digital sets and antennas.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The other is technological wizardry: young people who have grown up with laptops in their hands instead of remote controls are opting not to buy TV sets when they graduate from college or enter the work force, at least not at first. Instead, they are subsisting on a diet of television shows and movies from the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Similarly, the economy was the reason cited by Nielsen when the percentage of homes with sets declined in 1992. That decline, the company’s report says, “also followed a prolonged recession and was reversed during the economic upswing of the mid-1990s.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do enjoy it when companies that refuse to change their business models try to defend themselves when they can see the own obsolesces off on the horizon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Nielsen is trying to say is that everything will get better but their own reports suggests that the young professional crowd is moving away from the model which works for them. Worse yet the young professional crowd, you know the group with disposable income that advertisers like to target, are moving towards a model the can be easily tracked through simple site statistics and worse yet are paying for the privilege to avoid ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nielsen’s relevancy dwindling is a good thing for television as an art because if each television show was only subjected to viewer numbers rather than whether or not advertisers are willing to be associated with it, we will get fewer first season innovative show cancellations.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>General Review of the Telco Situation</title>

  &lt;p&gt;I was learning the one thing most Canadians already know about their phone companies: They only treat you well when you treat them poorly. I’m not going to name the companies because you know their names – and, more to the point, they’re fundamentally interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very fact that they are interchangeable is what I want to focus on but from a different angle. I am going to name names but my difference is that because I am light user there is no way around my problem because there is absolutely no way to hurt the ‘service’ providers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I am deeply annoyed with Roger’s cellar service. I am a very minimal user and the best they could do for me is a 10 dollar a month pay as you go plan, which seems antithetical to the very concept of pay as go. They also charged me for a Sim card because I had the gaul of already owning a phone. This annoyed me but at the time they were the only GSM carrier in my region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, I happen to like paying my bills online and Rogers has consistently been making their website less and less usable over time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, however, Bell has gained GSM service and I went into a store to see what they were offering. They have a slightly better plan, which required me to give them 100 dollars a year but the per minute rate is only 30 cents rather than 40 cents rogers is charging me. Still they also wanted to charge me for a sim card. Whatever the amount is for the sim card, I forget the exact price, put the cost of switching to Bell over the price of just staying with Rogers. When I said as much to the poor girl at the store she just gave a bit of shrug. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t get it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does Bell not want my 100 dollars or would they just rather Rogers have the business? &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Welcome to the World of Tomorrow</title>

   &lt;p&gt;I said, as I held curled my hands around my lab coat.&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article-images/terry.png&quot; alt=&quot;terry&quot; title=&quot;Stop that Terry&quot; class=&quot;floatright&quot; /&gt; Okay not really, I took an arts degree so there were no lab coats despite one of my majors having the word science in it, but I think that most of my, presumed, audience should have that image floating about their memory banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grant that I am a huge fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/&quot; title=&quot;Really?&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Futurama&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but the actual idea of taking on this domain as my mantle has more to do with my love the same particular moment in recent human history that Futurama is riffing on. Although, I lean closer to the the Deco period rather than the ’50s with the mild exception that the world was actually in black and white – I can not forgive the pastels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That time period was filled with the optimism that we lost at some point. We were promised a better to tomorrow where we all would be happy and even have flying cars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomorrowland&quot; title=&quot;I was actually unaware of this part of Disneyland until the most recent Mad Men episode&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;TomorrowLand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; did not turn out that way. So thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/blankbaby&quot;&gt;Scott McNulty&lt;/a&gt; reminding me the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzm6pvHPSGo&quot; title=&quot;Made out of a great deal of awesome&quot;&gt;Avery Brooks IBM ad&lt;/a&gt; I began to question the type of software I was trying to use for my ruminations on living in the future. A different kind of software indeed.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-one-reinvent-the-axle&quot;&gt;Step One: Reinvent the Axle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; was not doing it for me on both a technical level and a design level. I don’t want much out of my blogging software but of things that I do want always seem to be hidden in some dark corner of php obfuscation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily for me there was &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2011/03/16/a_plea_for_baked_weblogs&quot;&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/18/brent-baked&quot;&gt;perfect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://5by5.tv/buildanalyze/18&quot;&gt;storm&lt;/a&gt; at the time surrounding the whole fireballing problem and a great many people were thinking about the problem and trying to find the best alternative to the standard wordpress install. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My requirements, at the time, were that it had to be in some format that I could read, meaning essentially php or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ruby-lang.org/&quot;&gt;ruby&lt;/a&gt; (with the preference leaning on ruby since I do not like php for obvious reasons), and could work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/&quot;&gt;Marsedit&lt;/a&gt;. I came &lt;a href=&quot;http://inessential.com/2011/03/17/more_on_baked_blogs&quot;&gt;across four options&lt;/a&gt; and ended up choosing Jekyll because I managed to find &lt;a href=&quot;http://dodgydev.net/2011/03/23/is_this_thing_on.html&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; that told me how to use marsedit with Jekyll. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That article was written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/jessereadd&quot;&gt;Jesse Read&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jessereadd/jessereadd.github.com&quot;&gt;very public coding&lt;/a&gt; was most helpful to me. In fact, this site is an unofficial fork of his. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I start altering things on the ruby code level I will probably make a github page and account but for right now all may changes are visible through the .css sheet and just the general code that is publicly visible. Despite them both being rather messy at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other major difference is that I had to abandon Marsedit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not do this lightly. I used Jesse Reads solution for importing all my tumblr posts and all my wordpress posts, from the previous site, but after a while I started to get annoyed because Marsedit is not supposed to be a text editor and I started using it more and more as lacklustre text editor. I wasted about a week fiddling with scripts until I figured out the solution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href=&quot;http://barebones.com/products/bbedit/&quot;&gt;BBedit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. I was using &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; to write my posts sure and having that preview option in Marsedit is great but BBedit has more or less the same function - standard mapping is cmd-ctrl p. Furthermore, BBedit has syntax highlighting for markdown so I can normally see a typo in the formatting without even previewing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-two--&quot;&gt;Step Two : ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the question mark? Well because this is kind of a beta release of what the site shall look like, in capable browsers, but it is taking me a while to make all the design decisions so I am just releasing now so I can get on with writing content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part this the HTML5 release and most of the ideas I am borrowing from &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/#!/malarkey&quot;&gt;Andy Clarke’s&lt;/a&gt; most ingenious book &lt;a href=&quot;http://hardboiledwebdesign.com/&quot;&gt;Hardboiled Webdesign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the site downgrades gracefully but I will be directing IE6 to a customized version of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/universal-ie6-css/&quot;&gt;universal ie6 style sheet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my side of things I have cobbled together some automator services to do some things but I should probably get around to learning &lt;a href=&quot;http://appscript.sourceforge.net/rb-appscript/index.html&quot;&gt;appscript&lt;/a&gt; to handle more complicated actions. I also need to write plugins to tie better into both Tumblr and Twitter and something else I have planned but that will be a surprise – if I ever get it working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than that I am mercurial man so look out for updates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;step-three-profit--&quot;&gt;Step Three: Profit …. ?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I changed domains – the old one was difficult to type and the joke was lost on most people – so now that my site has a better design and probably a more comprehensible title. Hopefully now I can focus on writing and stopped being annoyed with the software problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, how do I add a feature request to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/&quot;&gt;kramdown&lt;/a&gt; to add figure and figure caption to their superset?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Quintessential Question for a Prince: Is It Better to Be Loved or Feared?</title>

   <id>/2011/04/23/the-quintessential-question-for-a-prince-is-it-better-to-be-loved-or-feared</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;Well, it seems the Hitchens is up to his usual tricks. You know being a brilliant author but at the same time vaguely annoying to both those that object to his views and those that are almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Hitchens himself (I miss Douglas Adams’ voice amongst the British atheists). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2291497/&quot;&gt;in question&lt;/a&gt; is well written and posits an argument, which is something that most journalists seem to be terrified to do as of late, but it is the argument that I dislike. Now, I am not a huge fan of any of the iterations of the &lt;em&gt;House of Saxe-Coburg, and Gotha&lt;/em&gt;  but I am not particularly against them either or any of the Royal Houses for that matter – except one time when I was 19 but I was being a prick at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So late me take you through the flaws, or at least the contestable sections of his argument for a British Republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The queen took two major decisions quite early in her reign, neither of which was forced upon her. She refused to allow her younger sister Margaret to marry the man she loved and had chosen, and she let her authoritarian husband have charge of the education of her eldest son. The first decision was taken to appease the most conservative leaders of the Church of England (a church of which she is, absurdly, the head), who could not approve the marriage of Margaret to a divorced man. The second was taken for reasons less clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these decisions are internal family matters. Poor Margaret was left to chum the waters of a sorrowful sea because of the strange conventions of the British public circa 1950. I don’t think any family, at the time, would be quite so happy to welcome a divorced man into the family. Hell in the year 2011 my father is dating a divorced women and there is still the vague whiff of scandal amongst some the idiots that he associates himself with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as for the boarding school thing, which he is alluding to by having Prince Phillip’s taking charge of Charles education. That is just what was done of people in a certain class at that time as recounted in Steven Fry’s book &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moab_Is_My_Washpot:_An_Autobiography&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moab is my washpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even then I am from a family that was not particularly wealthy and I went off to boarding school in the late ’90s and the early part of the new Millennia and there was not a particular shortage of students, that I noticed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Together, Margaret and Charles set the tone for the dowdy, feckless, can’t-stay-married shower of titled descendants with whose names, let alone doings, it is near-impossible to keep up. There are so many of them! And things always have to be found for them to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some more to his analysis of the problems of Charles and Margaret but you can read the article in full latter but is really necessary to bring these peoples misery out on the stage yet again. Yes, mistakes were made in the family which lead to unhappy lives but what family has not made these types of mistakes. I have never sat a family table, I rarely sit at my own due to our dwindling numbers, that there was some sense vendetta and resentment next to the bread and to the left of the of the salt and pepper shakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For Prince William at least it was decided on the day of his birth what he should do: Find a presentable wife, father a male heir (and preferably a male “spare” as well), and keep the show on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umm …. how is this different from anybody eles. I am pretty sure my gay friend’s parents are still hoping this from him. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;[W]hen the Old Guard began snickering about the pedigree of young Ms. Middleton. Her parents, it appeared, were not quite out of the top drawer. The mother had been an air hostess or something with an unfashionable airline, and the family had been overheard using lethally wrong expressions, such as serviette for napkin, settee for sofa, and—I can barely bring myself to type the shameful letters—toilet for lavatory. Ah, so that’s what constitutes vulgarity! People who would never dare risk a public criticism of the royal family, even in its daytime-soap incarnation, prefer to take a surreptitious revenge on a young woman of modest background. For shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I agree but this is just the family being a bit stuffy. I remember being shoved into suits and being told to speak properly by my mother. Still it has nothing to do with the state and those rules of proprietary come from the British people not the Royals themselves. They do not exist in a vacuum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess my problem of this republican opportunism of Hitchens is that most of problems that he is talking about have to do with problem of living under the constant and watchful of eyes of the British public. Every failure in their lives is recorded and talked about and every success remember for a bittersweet moment and then dismissed by that public, which claims to love them, as the benefits of being born or a certain station. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure they are a bit of quirky, particularly German, family but that doesn’t mean they should be stripped of position. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And notice I said position. The reigning monarch has very little real substantive power. They no longer instill any fear in the public. They are symbolic family, with some means of their own I should mention, which provides a service to the public – chiefly bestowing honours on the public. And the public loves them for that reason.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which has a bit of irony to it considering the public’s thing seems to be to repeatedly and viciously victimize these people as only the feckless thuggery of true democracy can muster – or stomach. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why Steven Harper Should Be Booted Out</title>
   <link href="/2011/04/22/why-stephen-harper-needs-to-be-booted-out/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-22T14:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/04/22/why-stephen-harper-needs-to-be-booted-out</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;Let me clear the air. I am not strongly affiliated with any party. Instead I have tendency to vote for the best candiate in my riding. Living in Halifax’s south end this means that I have voted for the incomparable Alexa McDonough and Megan Leslie more recently but in my past, when I lived in Guelph, I voted for a Conservative candiate because the Liberal candidate was an empty shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only party leader I like is Ignatieff and I sincerely hope that the Liberals take a majority government again despite the fact that my vote will not be cast for the Liberal candiate in my riding – well maybe I have yet to decide. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is why I think Harper should be booted to curb. My reasons for that is because he is &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;dismal&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;failure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not referring to his inability to form a majority government, nor do I refer to the economic crisis, and I am most certainly not referring to anything, directly, that is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shitharperdid.ca/&quot;&gt;shitharperdid.ca&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, I am referring to his failure to unite the three sisters of canadian conservatism. I hear some of you asking “who the hell are they” in future perfect land so let me explain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before Harper was Prime Minister he used to wax poetic on the three zones of strong canadian conservatism. These zones were the west (quelle surprise), the centre, and the atlantic peoples. His challenge was that these three needed to be united so that a true Canadian conservatism could represent the truest nature of Canadians (I am paraphrasing of course).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this was from his days editing Knoff’s essays and hanging out in Alberta and is not really google friendly but if you go to any university library and look over the Canadian Political Science journals you will find these ideas floating around his name. So I do not think that it is unfair of me to say that he should have had this on agenda at some point in the last 6 years. Furthermore, considering that this is &lt;em&gt;his own&lt;/em&gt; goal for &lt;em&gt;his own&lt;/em&gt; party this should have be an easy thing for him to put in the win column.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well he didn’t succeed. He tried to play nice with the atlantic people, surely reminiscing as to how the centre just ignores the west and the east (wah!), by elevating Peter Mackay’s star. I think that worked well for Mackay but I don’t really think that really did the trick for the Atlantic region in general. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are all the cabinet reshuffles as he tries to maintain control over his own party and with each iteration he attempts to have stronger and stronger &lt;em&gt;personal control&lt;/em&gt; over the fold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the image of a man that is barley in control of himself. This is also the image of man that I don’t think should continue to be prime minster. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, too late I know, Harper should be voted out of office just so the Conservative party can get someone better. I mean really I feel sorry for them but my sympathy for the Tories of the country is not the only reason I think this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is good to have actual debate in the house of commons and Haper is not the man to have on either side of the aisle. There is dire need for new blood so we, as a country, can move forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps next time the Tories can find more successful and certainly more charming leader. That would be good for the party at least, and perhaps even the country as whole. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tim Minchin's Storm: The Animated Movie</title>
   <link href="/2011/04/11/tim-minchins-storm-the-animated-movie/"/>

   &lt;p&gt;Although this video perfectly sums up a particularly British form evangelical atheism which irritates me it has made me realize why &lt;a href=&quot;http://richarddawkins.net/&quot;&gt;Dawkins&lt;/a&gt; bothers me more than a standard religious or new age zealot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is because Dawkins, and the author of this poem, can in fact change their mind. You could win the argument therefore there is a reason to fight. A religious person, at the best of times, will simply just pretend that you are not talking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This realization comes with the baggage that apparently I have just given up on a large section of humanity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a happier note, the video also reminded me of an argument I had with a priest (Greek Orthodox). Eventually we hit a juncture point in the argument, which was about whether or not the Church should be subjected to taxation, where he needed to use God to support he argument against(My argument was that they should simply have to prove their ‘good works’ like any other charity and I don’t think that ‘The Christ’ would be particularly against that). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Minchin though I did not go through a long tirade at that point on why my world view was better. I pinched the priests cheek and called him cute in the way you would a child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine is less poetic but possibly more practical.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>... That Word. I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means.</title>
   <link href="/2011/04/11/why-post-pc-doesnt-mean-sans-pc/"/>

   &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In fact, post PC means after PC, a new generation of products that build on the PC. What it doesn’t mean is sans PC, that is, without PC. The personal computer will no doubt be with us for a very long time… but that doesn’t mean we’re not in the post-PC world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the article is good I am slightly annoyed with the analysis of the prefix &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When post is attached to some term it usually means “is but no longer recognizable as”. For instance Post-Modernism is not after modernism but rather a “a type of modernism that is very different from the earlier form”. It is associating itself with modernism ;  as part of the continuity.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for the Ipad. It is a PC but no longer recognizable as a PC. It is a personal device that does some of the stuff that computer does but in an unrecognizable, as a computer, way. Well that point is debatable but I think is is what Apple is going after with the new term. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>(Reconsidering) Reconsidering the Feminism of Joss Whedon: Buffy Edition</title>
   <link href="/2011/04/09/reconsidering-reconsidering-the-feminism-of-joss-whedon-buffy-edition/"/>
   <updated>2011-04-09T12:43:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/04/09/reconsidering-reconsidering-the-feminism-of-joss-whedon-buffy-edition</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;Gah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay it seems Natasha Simons wrote about Buffy and Firefly as well. So instead editing my earlier post to deal with this I am going to deal with each one in its own separate post. Ha so there. Wait do I win? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Buffy, for all her killing vamps and breaking stuff, is rather a weak character … And Buffy is textually[sic] weak in all her relationships. She falls apart not only when Angel leaves her, but when Parker (yeah, you don’t remember him, either) doesn’t want to pursue more than a one-night stand with her, too. And Riley, well. Riley. Despite being an almost universally despised character, Whedon sends Riley out in a flurry of pique at Buffy, after being caught having his blood sucked by a vampiress in a modern-day opium den … She reacts with the appropriate level of scorn, before Xander, the Chronicler of Buffy’s Failures, lectures her on her failure as a girlfriend to Riley, her lack of adequate emotional support …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I win. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay as I mentioned in the last post, but in response to her third page for those keeping track, the concept of Buffy is derived from : “Cute blonde suburban cheerleader destroys monsters instead of the other way around.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She is still a young person. She will still make mistakes and at times she is a little narcissistic. Aren’t we all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it be helpful to the plot, or be entertaining, that she be old and wise from birth? Seriously what is the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let’s consider that she, as a Slayer, descends from a line that was literally created by men – a formation that stems directly from the male anxiety over an inability to create life the way that women do. And inherently problematic is the idea of the Watcher, a predominantly male presence that is the male gaze made manifest …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The what now. Seriously I am all for digging deep but this reading just is not there. There is nothing to support it. It seems to me that it is male inadequacy is rather prevalent in the shows mythos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact Xander, Spike, Riley, Angel, and Giles all seem to have some deficiency of character. An inability to cope alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, that is most people in general. This is just a theme in Whedon’s work. We are stronger together than alone. It is slightly intensified because the characters are younger and prone to more mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As has been pointed out by the magnificent Buffy scholar Eleusis Walks (to whose blog you should go post haste following this article), Faith is essentially a foil for Buffy, her shadow self. Whereas Buffy has approved-by-Whedon sex with her steadfast boyfriends whom she loves, Faith is a sexual free agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True except for the “Whedon approved” sex thing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffy is a suburban teen/20 something. She takes on the ideas of that culture. I think it would be odd that a suburban teenager would have a fully developed thought pattern on how to handle sexual relationships with no experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact I have always been in the minority of people that did not like Buffy as much as it seems I should, according to all the people around me. I always felt that Whedon didn’t mine the whole very powerful person in disaffected America as deep as he should have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still I don’t think this critique holds much water. &lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2011-04-09T10:21:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/04/09/reconsidering-reconsidering-the-feminism-of-joss-whedon-firefly-edition</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;This one is a bit shorter just because less is to be said that I already &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldoftomorrow.ca/2011/04/09/reconsidering-reconsidering-the-feminism-of-joss-whedon-dollhouse-edition/&quot;&gt;haven’t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldoftomorrow.ca/2011/04/09/reconsidering-reconsidering-the-feminism-of-joss-whedon-buffy-edition/&quot;&gt;dealt&lt;/a&gt; with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Zoe Washburne is possibly the strongest character that Whedon ever created. The fact, too, that she is a woman of color, does not go unnoticed or unappreciated by me, especially after the Magical Negro nonsense inherent in the Primitive Slayer storyline on Buffy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No that was more an ancient magic thing. Still stupid in my opinion but most stories with magic in them have this so it comes with the package. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In Whedon’s future reality, prostitution is the a woman’s highest form of good. There’s no shortage of mentions in Firefly’s 14 episodes of how noble and prestigious Inara’s profession is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I seem to remember Inara’s one female client is some sort of high ranking official that can afford a bodyguard for laughs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In fact, the only time Inara’s profession is degraded is when a man – Mal – wants a more lasting claim put to her, his own, and asserts his arbitrary requirements and ownership over her. Think about it: every time Mal has a problem with Inara, he brings up their monetary arrangement for her leased shuttle – that’s Mal reasserting his dominance over her. Which is presented as romance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh. That feels like feminism, and not particularly good feminism at that, in the early ’80s. Can I refute it sure but what is that point. If you go through life looking at every exchange between the genders as power struggle I doubt you will end up happy. Still if you want to do that go ahead. I have put up with errant solidi floating about in grammatically conspicuous places for my entire life. The overreaching arm of the patriarchy is just icing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ooo icing. Maybe I should get away from the computer and go have a cupcake. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>(Reconsidering) Reconsidering the Feminism of Joss Whedon: Dollhouse Edition</title>
   <link href="/2011/04/09/reconsidering-reconsidering-the-feminism-of-joss-whedon-dollhouse-edition/"/>

   <id>/2011/04/09/reconsidering-reconsidering-the-feminism-of-joss-whedon-dollhouse-edition</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lschmeiser/status/56054822234890240&quot; title=&quot;Via twitter obviously. I don't know any cool smart people personally.&quot;&gt;Lisa Schmeiser linked me to an article&lt;/a&gt; and something irked me about it. I wasn’t sure what it was and I happened to be busy that day so it did not occupy much of my mind space. Still the article seemed to be sitting in the back of the my mind throwing a tennis ball, distractingly, against my prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate it when this happens and honestly it hasn’t happened for quite some time but this morning while I was sitting in my favourite café I overheard some of the people that worked in my almae matris – my, I have moved far haven’t I – nattering on about their various student’s theses. The tennis ball started going faster. Not since my undergrad had I heard such failed attempts at understanding &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler&quot; title=&quot;Not really a Dame (British Sense)&quot;&gt;Dame Judy Butler&lt;/a&gt;. So then armed with thoughts about subjectivity, objectivity, and gender I went back to the article, which was written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://natface.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;Natasha Simons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article starts off fine enough but Natasha seems to be shocked that there is violence in an action show. Some people don’t like action &lt;em&gt;dramas&lt;/em&gt; and that’s okay. There are other things on TV. But that section does not really bother me. This section on the other hand … &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you’ll permit the academic tangent, Dollhouse merits recollection of film critic Laura Mulvey and her brilliant thesis, which identified the gaze of the audience in film (or television, updated) as male. It also identified the gaze of the writer and director as male, and the ways in which that manifests itself onscreen. Mulvey found that a disturbing thread had emerged in cinema, a psychological expression of male insecurity: when a female character is strong or otherwise opaque to the male viewer, there are generally two options at hand. The visual medium tends to answer the anxiety of the male by “demystifying the mystery, counterbalanced by the punishment of the guilty object.” What this means in layman’s terms is that the woman must be unmasked (usually by sexual intercourse) or punished with harm for refusing to submit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems to be what irked me a bit because I know that Whedon is somewhat Sartrean himself so I am not entirely sure that this subconscious desire which Mulvey was talking about is necessarily a problem for Whedon. After all the whole concept of &lt;em&gt;Buffy: The Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt; was by the reversal of subject and object in the sentence “Cute blonde girl gets destroyed by monster” that was in many of the scripts that Mulvey is talking about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article does not end there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… Echo is the ultimate male fantasy – she is a woman that literally anything can be done to for the right amount of money, with those actions then simply erased afterward. See, it’s all right, because she (and the other dolls) won’t remember! The show perpetrates the worst kinds of violence on its female characters. Over the course of the two seasons on-air, Echo is repeatedly used for intercourse and made to pretend she enjoys it, one woman is removed from doll status because of a physical deformity, another female is steadily and terrifyingly raped by her male handler – and even the term “handler” suggests a male role intended to actively control …  Putting [Echo] in a variety of sexy spandex and ever-more dangerous situations is a thrill, and the audience, watching, also thrilled, is complicit in Echo’s subjugation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umm, I seem to remember stubbornly watching this show and I don’t remember siding with the any of the perpetrators of these actions. In fact I think the show went to great lengths to demonize the people in control of the Dollhouse network and made damn sure that the Dolls where seen as victims. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a tawdry sense wouldn’t this make a the show more feminist. It depicts a world where men abuse their power and money to use women (well mainly women) who were so victimized by the male run world that they had to run and hide. Then their hiding place perpetuates their victimization and eventually they are forced to take action against their oppressors. Overall isn’t that the story arc of the Dollhouse series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I don’t get this critique and I can’t really see where it is coming from other than a desire to talk about Joss Whedon’s supposed feminism.(Did he ever claim to be one, out of curiosity, or was it that a lot of self labeled third wavers happened to like Buffy?) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I always thought of &lt;em&gt;Dollhouse&lt;/em&gt; as a failed attempt of Whedon’s to explore his ideas about subjectivity versus objectivity and the interplay between the two in an age of brain/mind sciences. Kinda a second attempt at dealing with some of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bit.ly/gBVPHu&quot; title=&quot;relevant episodes&quot;&gt;themes of Firefly&lt;/a&gt; in a new wrapper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many faults with the series but I don’t think it was necessarily antagonistic to the feminist ascete.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Post-Roddenberry Trek and Why We All Abandoned Ship</title>
   <link href="/2011/03/19/post-roddenberry-trek-and-why-we-all-abandoned-ship/"/>
   <updated>2011-03-19T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/03/19/post-roddenberry-trek-and-why-we-all-abandoned-ship</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://dresdencodak.com/&quot;&gt;Aaron Diaz&lt;/a&gt; has been tweeting about &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; (not sure the colon is necessary anymore) and this has made me nostalgic for the days that family friendly was not restricted solely to Doctor Who.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that this is loss to the general public because if there is one thing that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_William_Shatner_Changed_the_World&quot; title=&quot;How William Shatner Changed The World&quot;&gt;William Shatner has made clear is that a great many children were inspired by Star Trek to create an actual better future&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time I realize that Paramount made two terrible series and that Deep Space Nine is the only good one from that post-Roddenberry era ; even then only after it found its footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I shouldn’t even say that Voyager was a complete a write off either. There were some good episodes but they are spread few and far between and usually involve &lt;a href=&quot;http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Doctor&quot; title=&quot;The Non-British Doctor with No Name&quot;&gt;Robert Picardo&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/B%27Elanna_Torres&quot; title=&quot;B'Ellanna Torres&quot;&gt;Roxann Dawson&lt;/a&gt; dealing with an ontological crisis — I freely admit I am sympathetic towards Belanna story lines because I come from a multicultural household where my more recognizable lineage was the less dominate in my childhood. What can I say, I am a narcissist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people blame techno-bable for this demise; others blame attempts to use ‘T and A’ for increasing viewership; some just say that it is anachronic form of story telling; and I have even heard, and to my shame repeated, that it was entirely because the Janeway and Archer were not very good captains because of Kate Mulgrew and Scott Bakula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of those reasons are crap. The Original Star Trek, The Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine had their fair share of techno-bable - there was less of it granted but almost every mousetrap solution across all the Star Treks involves one actor spouting gibberish and then a second actor over-simplifying. The increasingly pretty cast is simply part of what is happening culturally with the new found cult to the body being amplified by Hollywood - hell just look at the cast of Cheers and compare them to the cast of How I Met Your Mother. The anachronic argument is out simply because a great many sci fi shows are trying to distance themselves from Star Trek either because they disliked Star Trek personally or trying to keep themselves from being rejected from Creative executives by disassociating their sci fi show from the failure of Voyager and Enterprise. And finally the captain thing is true to a certain extant because Kirk, Picard, and Sisko are all awesome in their unique way which was a strange hybrid between script and actor, whereas Janeway and Archer are mehish but I think that was just a symptom of script problems rather than a problem on the casting level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I disregarded all these reasons I must put forth my own theory. After all this is the internet. So what is considerate and wise opinion? Star Trek started sucking because more and more episodes started being about Star Trek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Roddenberry was kicking around Star Trek’s basic idea was an idealized form, particularly Humanist and oddly liberal considering the lack of capitalism, of Humanity was trekking around and encountering ‘other’ beings that had  problems which represented, usually in concentrated form, the problems of today. “But they have black on the other side of their body” queue Kirk face palm, “We have an asexual society but I think I am both a girl and am obviously sexually different despite how hard I try to hide it and I worry about societies judgment — also your beard makes me feel giddy.” queue bearded Riker makeout session, etc. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is simple enough formula but it works simply because it posits a workable solution as a completed action. The very existence of the advanced form of humanity in a utopic state is the worked out solution and then they, the future humans, have the opportunity to discuss and solve the problems of today through the use of the alien metaphor. It is essentially, for all you grammarians out there, a decent use of the future perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep Space Nine is a little different because when it became ‘good’ it mainly dealt with racism and the concept of how much of your principles, the idealist form of principles, could be sacrificed in its defence which honestly rings more true in the post September 11th world than the world of the ’90s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voyager, on the other hand, was about … ? … I don’t know really know. It could have been about forging new alliances, or as Babylon 5 put it “humans build communities”. It could have been about ontology - how much of the objective stuff that you are made of influences what you do - and to be honest the best episodes of the series hover around these ideas.  Hell it could have been what it means to have a home and then to be so far away from it that it would be unlikely to see it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is about none of these things but I get sense that it is trying to be all these things. When you have all these things pulling into various directions then all you really have is the core of the show, and the core of Star Trek is kinda of silly, if it can’t explore in any particular direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why we complain about the techno-bable and everything else. The show became about the plot of each episode rather than the metaphor which is a shame. I feel like the cast was capable of much more than what they were given and the character were most certainly capable of much more than what we saw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enterprise was even worse because it was about how that core came into existence plot wise. Instead of the transporter being invented by a writer to save on production costs there was an entire show on the why and hows the tech came in being. Instead of gene splicing not being addressed by the first two series simply because gene splicing was not really in the public knowledge at the time we have a whole song and dance about it — in fact I think it was a two parter and I am sure there are other examples but my contact with Enterprise has been limited to me checking in on the series sporadically after I got pissed off at the episode where the Dog gets sick, then something about a bat, and oh the hilarity because nothing says hijinks like a beloved pet having a terminal disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Star Trek was supposed to be about our better selves exploring the problems caused by our lesser demons that we have today rather than exploring itself. It is supposed to be the fiction that exalts us not the explanation of 10 000 facts about fictive technology and science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss having a better self on television because when the tv is off all I can see is the dark reflection of me as I am.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, Nathan Fillion did an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/02/17/firefly-returns/&quot; title=&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&gt;EW&lt;/a&gt; saying that if he had a won the California lottery he would buy the rights to the Firefly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fan response was unusually enthusiastic and there seemed to be more than a few to many people wanting to collect money so that Nathan Fillion could buy the show. I am force to ask, Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to say that I don’t like Nathan Fillion. He is one of the major reasons I started watching Castle - well that and the fact that I have a thing for Stana Katic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I happen to agree that Fox is not the appropriate custodian of this show. They didn’t know how to handle it on the air, canceled it, and yet continue to make money from it depsite those facts which irritates me greatly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the fans of Firefly are going to unite around buying the rights to the show why not crowd source the money to buy the rights to the show for &lt;em&gt;yourselves&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seriously, treat it like stock in a company. Just hire a lawyer, or whatever entity is needed to negotiate the price for the rights, and then collect money. The person that puts the most money would be the majority share holder and you could just put Joss Whedon, or even Nathan Fillion, as the creative equivalent of the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you could all vote and fund another season if all the players can be placed, or make an animated show, or do nothing other than stop giving Fox your money every time time a new format comes out. Or to put it words that may be vaguely more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fox took the sky from you. Take it back.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Most people that are connected to the internet today have heard or seen something about the recent Apple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/02/15appstore.html&quot; title=&quot;Apple Pr&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; which is hardly surprising given the recent problem that they have had with Sony. Apple does not usually make missteps but it does happen — mobile me anyone — and I fear that this is one of them. And it’s a dozy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly there are some consumer advantages to the new scheme of things. Some examples would be that you can manage your subscriptions in one place, there will be an option to keep your private data from being sold, and simple purchasing in app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But … &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 70/30 cut is quite simply unreasonable for subscriptions given the fact that they don’t have to handle the bandwidth of the updates.  On the positive side they are still allowing you to buy things outside the app without the need for a fee. ﻿I will also conceded that there is a small argument that subscription styled programs should have to be paid applications so that Apple does not need to eat the cost of sending the app itself though. Still this is fight between the media providers and Apple and shouldn’t concern the users all that much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will effectively kill off a few things that gives &lt;em&gt;extra&lt;/em&gt; value to the IOS product line. Having the ability to read your Kindle purchases on the Ipad or Iphone adds value to the system because it allows users to have the familarity of a common bookstore on their shiny new apple products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the problem of something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://globe2go.newspaperdirect.com/epaper/viewer.aspx&quot;&gt;Globe 2 Go&lt;/a&gt;. The subscription covers the ability to have the Globe and Mail on many devices not just Apple made devices. So why would should Apple get a monthly cut when it just happened that I started the service on an IOS device. Then again I can see the Globe and Mail just making an ultra fancy html 5 site for the Ipad and make that part of the Globe 2 Go platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Kindle I can see Amazon doing one of two things. Either the will make just pull the app from the store or they will make the search function so broken, in app, that people will just get it from the web store anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if Apple doesn’t do anything about this many publishers will just leave the App store I don’t think that it will hurt Apple all that much, similar to how nobody really cares about the current mobile me, but what I can’t figure out is why the decision was made when it obviously takes some value away from Apple &lt;em&gt;products&lt;/em&gt; that users buy and adds nothing except for some residual income for Apple itself. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why doesn't this exist? Babylon 5 Edition</title>
   <link href="/2011/02/14/why-doesnt-this-exist-babylon-5-edition/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-14T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/02/14/why-doesnt-this-exist-babylon-5-edition</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;This morning, over tea, I was enjoying my little re-watch of Babylon 5. I love this show a great deal and I think that it is one of the best examples of television writing out there. I know it is not the most popular show in existence, probably due to a painful pilot and middling first season, but those that like it are nearly rabid about the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this means is that the two things that I am about to purpose has an audience and a predictable sales count. So without further ado :  Why don’t these exist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;babylon-5-20&quot;&gt;Babylon 5 2.0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure there is a problem with the Buffy master tapes due to the first season being shot on 16 mm but Babylon does not have this handicap. It was shot Super 35mm with widescreen in mind. The only problem is that the special effects were done on an Amiga and have not aged well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not just redo the special effects with modern computers and release something like remastered &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_2.0#Remastered_series&quot;&gt;The Original Star Trek series&lt;/a&gt;. You could cash in on both a rebroadcast with some network and the new sales from at least an optical release, before those vanish, and a digital release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to say that the originals should be destroyed but any fan could easily have both versions and squabble about which is better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-complete-scripts-digital-edition&quot;&gt;The Complete Scripts: Digital Edition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 5 years ago, there was a release of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cafepress.ca/b5books&quot; title=&quot;I want these so Bad&quot;&gt;15 volume set of the Scripts and notes concerning the series&lt;/a&gt;. They are currently doing one off lottery draws of the remaining prints but I can not understand why there is no digital version. If there is obviously a ridculously high demand, $1000 for used copies, why have these not been thrown up on the Amazon Kindle store. Even a digital store could be set up to sell an epub or pdf copies of the things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could easily generate money with little cost; in fact no cost, except profit sharing, if they were release on ibooks or the kindle store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is not link they have to be retyped or anything. This was done in 2006 so there must a computer file which could be reformatted or just printed as pdf for gods sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the extra money aside it would be a valuable resource for those that want to write good television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I ask the rights holders: Why don’t these exist?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Numbers vs Metaphors</title>
   <link href="/2011/02/12/numbers-vs-metaphors/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/02/12/numbers-vs-metaphors</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;This morning I was just filtering through the news feeds about Egypt and I noticed an extraordinary quote. It seemed simple enough. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12437827&quot; title=&quot;Egyptians celebrate a new era in history&quot;&gt;John Simpson&lt;/a&gt;, of the BBC, simply put that Egypt was for the first time in 5000 years getting to pick their leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is fine enough but I don’t think that the scale is really communicated through this line and with a quick google search people seem to like to toss around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.ca/search?client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=5000+years+egypt&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;redir_esc=&amp;amp;ei=H6JWTbbrOsnOgAeNiZmGDQ&quot;&gt;5000 year idea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I think communicates the scale of what is going on would be to say “For the first time in recorded history Egyptians will pick their leader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my minds eye, or whatever, I can imagine myself in the large cavernous library that would be required to contain all that is history. I can see all the books. I can feel the very weight of the crumbled statue of ﻿Ozymandias and more importantly I can hear the echos of jubilant celebration reflecting against all of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe its just me but I think the metaphor of saying that in all that has been written this has not be written before is more powerful an image than simply saying the number. Then again I could be wrong, maybe the number is better for a society that is so math obsessed. Opinions?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The year of Linux but Not As You Imagined It</title>
   <link href="/2011/02/09/the-year-of-linux-but-not-as-you-imagined-it/"/>
   <updated>2011-02-09T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/02/09/the-year-of-linux-but-not-as-you-imagined-it</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;Some time ago, a non-computer oriented friend asked me about Linux. I am guessing this takes place some time around early 2008 because I remember I was running Fedora full time and somewhat pining for a Mac.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially the conversation boiled down to that he was unhappy with Vista and was wondering if he could just switch to Linux. My answer was no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He simply could not just because it was not easy to run Linux at the time; or even now for that matter. He needed support, tutorials, and a system that did not require you to go into the command line. I did know that some people were successful living this kind of life style with Ubuntu but if something broke the fora would usually tell you to jump into terminal. For a guy where word is complicated for him Linux could not solve his computing needs. What he needed to do reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He then asked if Linux would ever be ready for normal people without a geeky friend. My prediction was that Linux is already ready on some levels but what is needed is the hardware manufactures — my list was HP, Sony, and Dell — needed to decide that Microsoft products were somehow devaluing their product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like that day has come. Although I was only vaguely interested in the TouchPad but I was surprised that HP annocued them scaling it up to their desktops and laptops. This is kinda of the reverse of what Apple did but the intergration is still there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If HP manages to field this OS into the market I think the days of Microsoft supremacy may be coming to a close. I can already see Sony fiddling with Android and if HP is successful in their run I can think of no reason for Sony to stay if they think they can better deal with Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well do think this is beginning of the end for Microsoft market-share dominance or just a soon to be failed experiment?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Globe 2 Go vs. The Daily</title>

   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;Not So Long Ago …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Mysterious Land …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of Toronto, Canada …&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;The Globe and Mail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://globe2go.newspaperdirect.com/epaper/viewer.aspx&quot;&gt;Was Dating a Printing Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, as you can imagine, was uncomfortable for all present. I think that is was a from the break up last year. A whirlwind romance with &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTVglobemedia#Reorganization_and_CHUM_Limited_merger_.282006-2010.29&quot; title=&quot;CTVglobemedia&quot;&gt;Toronto Star&lt;/a&gt;. Really, his parents tried to help. Father Bell tried to remove all reference to what happened but it was still obvious that he was hurting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What he did is understandable, I guess. He just did what we all do when set adrift both heartbroken and rudderless. We go for what is familiar. It’s a little embarrassing but we all go through it right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it was okay for a while but now it is just getting ridiculous.  Sure it looks like he is trying to date Ipads, Androids, and I think I even saw him flirting with a Kindle but really every night he goes home and sits there are thinking about the printing press as his true love. Ugg this mourning period is taking too long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard, while the snowstorm was in the ‘States, that Rupert Murdock and the Ipad were getting a little serious. I know they had a big party to celebrate their new found relationship and I have to admit that those two getting together seemed like it would be interesting enough so I gave it look. Even if it was just out of morbid curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gah it was worse than the Globe and Mail. Murdock was treating her like a type glossy printing press but cheaper and faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the obsession with News men wanting to date printing presses? I can understand the outfit and all but it is all kinda of ridiculous at this point. Haven’t we all grown up enough to not be messing with Gutenburg’s daughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the Globe and Mail specifically as he is my friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think he’s really got to start to grow up and move on. We all indulged it for a while but I am not sure it is healthy. Murdock knows that he has to move on but the cosplay is a little creepy. Don’t you think it’s time both them start to forget their old sweet hearts and try to date someone new?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cloud</title>
   <link href="/2011/01/30/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-cloud/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-30T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/01/30/how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-cloud</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;I am a keyboard enthusiast. My keyboard of choice was made in the early ’90s, the venerable &lt;a href=&quot;http://lowendmac.com/thomas/06/1019.html&quot;&gt;Apple Extended II&lt;/a&gt;, and this keyboard is an ADB monstrosity that is actually heavier than my current primary, and only, computer; a Macbook Pro 13 inch(Mid-2010).  All this means is that I have quite obviously been working with computers for a long time and have developed a lot of cranky old man habits in my workflow despite the fact I am still at a tender age.  All of this must be understood if anything wonderful is going to come from this little tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It starts, as many tales do, by something bouncing on the docks. The Mac App Store had finally launched and I was fiddling around with it. At some juncture I saw a small bowler that looked a little familiar. The icon was for an app named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfredapp.com&quot;&gt;Alfred&lt;/a&gt;, presumably after the most famous butler in popular fiction. I had encounter Alfred once before in the summertime. A friend of mine called it a better version of spotlight and just left it that. I looked at the site in passing but was feeling lazy and promptly forgot about the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here it was again. Sitting there. So hat like and one thing I know from my experience is that if a hat is just sitting in a room someone is going to have to put it on. Why do you think that Crown Jewels are so heavily guarded? So with one click of the mouse I put on the damn hat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went over my life with computers and thought about all the little quirks that each system brought. From the days of using my &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_file_manager&quot;&gt;spatial memory to find what file&lt;/a&gt; or program  I wanted to work with to the present and my life with finder, spotlight, and safari. The workflow was always to decide on what I needed the computer to do and where to do it. It is how it always been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I started to use the program. At first he seemed just a bit faster than the norm and easier to read than spotlight. Nothing that special but then the wondrous thing happened. I typed the name of a program I did not have on my computer. It was on the old one and I had not reinstalled since getting the a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hitting return, more out of habit than anything, I was presented with a google search for the application and the top of the page. Within a few seconds I was doing what I had intended on doing despite my error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internet had always been a wilderness that the timid spotlight dare not step outside the fine cobbled streets of my well organized machine. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgeAQioXyYA#t=24s&quot; title=&quot;Alfred Pennyworth&quot;&gt;Alfred has no fear of this jungle&lt;/a&gt; If he doesn’t see what you are looking for locally he allows you to channel your search off to the greater world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat and thought about my old ways where the internet and the local machine were to be treated differently. The projected future of clouds ceased having rainbows in it and started being wet and cold. A world where I would not only have to think where the application might be and its purpose but whether or not that application was online or offline and even if I was connected. My head began to swirl. The OS simply did not extend into the world. It stayed home and I was its prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future, and my freedom, from the chains of the local versus networked computer model seem to be broken by Alfred. The weight of picking the right program has been taken off my shoulder and put onto his. Now all I have to do is decide on what I want to do not where I want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an added side effect of this program,﻿ my apartment is now filled with the soft melody of alps switches … switching. Gone are the cacophonic stops to switch from home row to the swiping and clicking world of the magic mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has made me a happier man. If not a mildly fanciful and hyperbolic man.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Are Manuals Good or Bad for Video Games?</title>
   <link href="/2011/01/26/are-manuals-good-or-bad-for-video-games/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-26T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/01/26/are-manuals-good-or-bad-for-video-games</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;As I was reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://kotaku.com/5743936/the-flimsy-mass-effect-2-instruction-manual-one-year-later&quot; title=&quot;kotaku&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;this about the fact that video game manuals are falling into disrepair I began to wonder if manuals were good for video games as an art form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand in that in the eighties it was not only necessary but prudent to have instructions because almost every game was different in its play style and tutorials didn’t quite exist in game until the early nineties, if memory serves. The manual was there to make sure we could make sense of the pixelated world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, on the other hand, most games follow a controller scheme that has more or less the same relative button positions across the genre and even the platforms. When a developer thinks he knows better there is backlash. Just think how obnoxious it is to hold x(playstation version) to run in ﻿Batman Arkham Asylum despite the fact there was a good reason for it - you wouldn’t want to accidentally run in a stealth game now would you.  Even with the standard conventions there are still lengthy tutorials through out most games. There is always a chance to learn what the new do-hicky does and how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, video games tell their story in-game through a more cinematic means that were not available during the 8 and 16 bit eras. There is no longer a need for a preamble paragraph to explain the game with you have opening cinematic and voice acting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this makes the manual not a particularly useful thing in practical terms and to be honest most of the time I don’t even look at the things but is it necessarily a good idea to take the player out of an immersive experience to teach them to play the game ? Some games treat it as part of the early exposition, others prefer a tutorial level or section which is either outside the main story or a very small section of it, or just constantly reminding the player of what buttons to press.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All these techniques sacrifice some immersion for the sake of playability but which is best? To be honest I think the manual was the best solution just because it is completely outside the players experience, during the in-game story, and to be fair most players will figure out the controls without a tutorial in a few attempts anyway but it is simply nice to have the reference.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sparrow Mail App Pricing Problems</title>
   <link href="/2011/01/25/sparrow-mail-app-pricing-problems/"/>
   <updated>2011-01-25T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>/2011/01/25/sparrow-mail-app-pricing-problems</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;If you are a Mac Gmail user chances are that you have heard of Sparrow Mail by this point and chances are you have seen the recent uproar concerning &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.sparrowmailapp.com/post/2908697184/sparrow1-0&quot; title=&quot;Sparrow Blog&quot;&gt;the proposed price&lt;/a&gt;.The good people that make Sparrow have already replied and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/sparrowmailapp/status/29663630463074304&quot;&gt;might be reconsidering&lt;/a&gt; their pricing scheme but still I think there is more to the uproar than their user base being stingy. So here are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back I had a conversation with another Sparrow user about what the price for the software should be. He was honestly fine with the ad version and all the power to him but I would prefer to support the developers directly and I spend a lot of time in my email client so I would prefer not to have such a large add placed at the top of my inbox. Still I gauged the value of sparrow, based on its current feature list to be somewhere between 10 and 15 dollars. 10 being what I considered to be a fair price and 15 being what I would grudgingly pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not cheap and honestly I only have the one email account that I use with any frequency so I could use the free one but there is a reason why I am pricing it so low and that is because the breathing space for the Sparrow Mail has already been taken up by not just one decent client but two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sparrow has to compete with Mail.app and it has to compete with the Gmail web interface which are both quite useable and to further complicate things it is not able to complete supplant either of them completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sparrow mail  is limited to gmail, at the moment, but will always be limited to imap whereas Mail.app can handle other protocols readily. Mail.app has some other features which I don’t use but some people might want to use that Sparrow would probably never be able to replicate. (e.g, Stationery)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further complicate matters Sparrow can not fully replace Gmail’s web interface either. It cannot create filters, at least that I am aware of, and that means I still have to log into gmail every time I need to adjust them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that Sparrow is not my favourite email client that I have used in a long time. I especially like that I can label email, albeit manually, and that I can use Apple shortcuts and Gmail shortcuts at the same time. I also find the UI design to be top notch but still I price the software a bit lower because there were two free alternatives that I will still have to us anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netscape was suffocated out of existence by IE despite being a great deal better than IE. Sparrow is trying to break into a market that already has two heavy breathers in the room. Maybe a lower price point will be their oxygen tank.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;driven time and again off course …&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;cite&gt;Robert Fagles’ Translation of the Odyssey&lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This started as a little late addendum to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldoftomorrow.ca/2010/04/22/the-citizen-kane-of-video-games/&quot;&gt;Citizen Kane of Video Games article&lt;/a&gt;. The reason for my sudden renewed interest is because at the time of writing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; piece I had yet to play the &lt;a href=&quot;http://orange.half-life2.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half Life 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series and I feel like that was an error on my behalf. In order to rectify this I will simply write about the things that can be found in the &lt;em&gt;Half Life&lt;/em&gt; series that may be helpful at advancing the medium as an art form which I did not talk about in the original article and beyond that have a bit of a rethink about the Citizen Kane analogy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;im-sorry-i-couldnt-quite-make-that-out&quot;&gt;I’m Sorry I Couldn’t Quite Make That Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and most obvious narrative device is that &lt;em&gt;Half Life&lt;/em&gt; series has is a silent protagonist. The advantage of keeping your protagonist mute is that you can better integrate player and character and there are many ways to keep you character mute. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bioware.com/&quot;&gt;Bioware’s&lt;/a&gt;, and other rpg makers, standard approach is that we are presented with a very particular character which has been completely created by us. &lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Gordon_Freeman&quot;&gt;Gordon Freeman&lt;/a&gt; is somewhat different, however, in a positive way. We have only seen a small portion of his life but at the same time we know him quite well and do get hints of a life lived outside of the confines of the invisible walls and still this is not quite the avatar presented in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_series&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; series that I talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.worldoftomorrow.ca/2010/04/22/the-citizen-kane-of-video-games/&quot;&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Samus_Aran&quot; title=&quot;Metroid's Protagonist&quot;&gt;Samus&lt;/a&gt; is quite different than Gordon beyond just being a different gender. Until recently, and I will not include &lt;a href=&quot;http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Other_M&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other M&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the rest of the series, Samus is a pretty much a blank slate that had some information plugged in by the gameplay. You never really get the sense that she existed outside of the world that we were presented. Sure there are some references of a life lived in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Zero_Mission&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zero Mission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game and &lt;a href=&quot;http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Fusion&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but even those referenced stories seemed to only be rather boring interludes between the &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; games. Samus’ important stories are all experienced directly and all those stories are extraordinary.  Given that she is an intergalactic bounty hunter, this is hardly surprising and I would also say that Link is similar in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gordon is not an intergalactic bounty hunter. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Wallace_Breen&quot;&gt;Breen&lt;/a&gt; aptly put it, he barely had his Ph.D.before being thrown into the mess of the &lt;em&gt;Half Life&lt;/em&gt; universe. The ordinary section of Gordon’s life is there for us to assume and understand due to the fact that he is somewhat similar to us.  For instance, when &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Eli_Vance&quot;&gt;Eli Vance&lt;/a&gt; start &lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Half-Life_2_storyline#Black_Mesa_East&quot;&gt;to explain the state of the world to Gordon&lt;/a&gt; there is no to little back story telling how much Gordon liked or disliked his co-workers or any other diarrhetic exposition because we all have lived a life that has that sort of thing that we can imagine what work was like before the original &lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Half-Life&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game started. We are already grounded in that type of reality and this type of less-is-more narrative style allows for the player to insert elements of his own life with certain limits. Similar to the pathology of ‘that guy’ at the party that always fills in the bits to your interesting story — correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also why there is &lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Half_life_storyline#Black_Mesa_Inbound&quot; title=&quot;Black Mesa Inbound - Half Life&quot;&gt;that fairly long scene&lt;/a&gt; in the first &lt;em&gt;Half Life&lt;/em&gt; which consisted of Gordon running around normal tasks and being a bit of prankster. It is not merely tutorial that informs us how to play but it is also grounding us in the ordinary that allows us to fill in the blanks with our own life. Also this little scene allows not just us to experience the extraordinary but also Gordon when the true game begins. This is way of fusing our and his personalities in a unique way. It differs from the experience in &lt;a href=&quot;http://metroid.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_prime&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; because we are never entirely sure of Samus’ reaction to anything without the aid of a scream or severe pantomime. Gordon doesn’t even have the aide of pantomime but we know that he is a fairly normal guy, likes to have beer, and works in a normalish type of job. So other than the occasional grunt of pain we can judge, with some accuracy,  the emotional resonance of the scene through our own psyche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the &lt;em&gt;Half Life 2&lt;/em&gt;, however, has a different way of integrating our psyche into the immediate extraordinary which is also worth noting for those plots that do not have ability to start in an office space. The train ride and opening scene are distinctly formed to feed on the ideas of totalitarianism that lie around western liberal society. In the same way that the infamous &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN6eFGGHrXs&quot;&gt;1984 Apple Ad&lt;/a&gt; we feel like we are under one of any number of regimes that are imagined with the vocative big bother fused with reality of Eastern European and Soviet imagery. This short introduction to the world immediately tells us everything we need to know about the principle players of the universe that are new through our own  href=””&amp;gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell&quot; title=&quot;Really? Come On!&quot;&gt;Orwellian&lt;/a&gt; - cold war cultural &lt;em&gt;leitmotifs&lt;/em&gt;. When we finally see Barney we encounter home once again and are firmly grounded as a xenotype to this universe rather than being the a defender against the xenotypes that we were in the first game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;without-friends-no-one-would-choose-to-live&quot;&gt;Without Friends No One Would Choose to Live&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I felt that &lt;em&gt;Half Life 2&lt;/em&gt; had a tendency to drag on in places. This is not because of poor writing but rather my own version of ADD, I am somewhat like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/&quot; title=&quot;Short Circuit&quot;&gt;Johnny 5&lt;/a&gt; and need constant narrative input, coupled with the fact I do not like the FPS games all that much in general. This is not to say I didn’t enjoy the game but I felt after a while in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Half-Life_2_storyline#Water_Hazard&quot; title=&quot;Water Hazard - Half Life 2&quot;&gt;Water Hazard&lt;/a&gt; level I was just waiting, and waiting, and then waiting some more just to get to the god damn story to start again. Mind you there were things keeping me entertained but I found that the pacing was a little off there and a few other spots which drew attention to the ‘long corridor’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was thankfully fixed in the first episode by the entrance of &lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Alyx_Vance&quot;&gt;Alyx Vance&lt;/a&gt; as a persistent &lt;em&gt;relatable&lt;/em&gt; companion. Which could have easily ended up as being an annoying feature if she either dragged Gordon through the plot, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.valvesoftware.com/&quot;&gt;Valve&lt;/a&gt; discovered was a problem in beta, or if she was not so carefully written. The first point is that we have to believe that Alyx can exist in our world not just the world of &lt;em&gt;Half Life 2&lt;/em&gt;. Valve accomplishes this feat, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.square-enix.com/&quot;&gt;Square-Enix&lt;/a&gt; has not be able to do since the days of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_fantasy_vi&quot; title=&quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot;&gt;SNES&lt;/a&gt;, by giving her reactions that would also function in our world without the demands of the a &lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Combine&quot;&gt;Combine&lt;/a&gt; run world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_one_storyline#Direct_Intervention&quot; title=&quot;Direct Intervention - Half Life 2 Episode 1&quot;&gt;Stalker train crashes&lt;/a&gt; and she is stuck under one of the Stalkers that is screaming in her face she reacts the way anyone would. She also seems shaken right after which again does not make her some weak female character it just somebody would react under those circumstances. Just think of your reaction if they took the face of a stalker screaming and put in a close focal distance up on the screen. I don’t think I would be as shaken but I do think the chair would have rolled back a couple of feet. I also remember an instantly charming scene,&lt;a href=&quot;http://half-life.wikia.com/wiki/Episode_one_storyline#Lowlife&quot; title=&quot;Lowlife - Half Life 2 Episode 1&quot;&gt;during the Lowlife chapter&lt;/a&gt;, when I was charging my flashlight she was obviously making zombie noises. I quickly clicked on my flashlight and shone it on her and from the acting of the character to the switching from a Zombie impression to the gotcha face. It is hard to imagine anyone not smiling after that. Also, her bad “zombine” joke made me laugh. Fine, she is not &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noël_Coward&quot; title=&quot;Him too?&quot;&gt;Noël Coward&lt;/a&gt; but she is not some action hero cliché either. She is a character that we get to know and become affectionate towards despite and in fact because of her foibles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that makes her the rare success in a video game characterization. The failure of most video games is that they want to make all their characters to have pure liquid awesome pumping through the characters cardiovascular system. Fine enough but that leads to what most people call comic book writing. If your protagonist, or any character for that matter, is too competent it makes for great escapism but also creates a problem for believability and drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a new idea. In fact it an idea that is in the western tradition very foundations. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad&quot;&gt;the Illiad&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hector&quot;&gt;Hector&lt;/a&gt; confronts the full rage of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles&quot;&gt;Achilles&lt;/a&gt; does he say “it has only just begun” or give some sort of hand gesture to show that he is ready for the climatic battle? For those of you that have not read the Iliad the answer is no. He does what a sensible man would do when be confronted by a fully armed enraged Greek man comes running at you. He high tales it. This does not detract form Hector’s position as a hero. In fact it intensifies it. From Hector’s reaction we can understand the awesome sight of the rage of Achilles and then we are moved even more when Hector turns to confront him. Hector is afraid to die and the fact that he is willing to confront Achilles is what makes him a hero. His willing to confront death is what makes him heroic. The very capacity to have fear and overcome is heroic which is why is was important that Alyx be able to show fear especially given the fact that Gordon can not express any emotion. Alyx is behaving, like Hector, as an emotional surrogate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-fools-these-mortals-be&quot;&gt;What Fools These Mortals Be&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, from the Iliad, if you were examine the story of the gods as a plot device you see the failure of have pure liquid awesome, the Greeks called it ichor, flowing through your veins. The gods are involved in the war but Homer always uses the divine narrative as a way &lt;em&gt;to relieve&lt;/em&gt; tension from the ongoing trails and tribulation of the mortal heros. The gods have nothing important at stake so they can not demonstrate anything of importance. They can just force plot points and act as clowns in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gordon Freeman and Alyx, since her death ends with a game over screen, can not die either. Sure your health bar can hit zero but you can just reload and try again. Some may mistake this as godhood of the two characters and I have seen some people claim that the protagonists have the rules of bend around them because of this feature but this a merely a superficial look and it is important to see the difference in an active narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hector can not die until Achilles kills him despite the fact that everyone knows that he is going to die by the end of Book 7. Achilles death is not even in the Iliad but we a constantly reminded that his choices through out the tale will result in his death. The is problem with plot is, unless you believe in fate or that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_peace&quot; title=&quot;War and Peace&quot;&gt;Train of History is very hard to derail&lt;/a&gt;, characters only die when it narratively useful which to be honest given the randomness of death around us in reality I sometimes yearn for, ever so desperately, for death of my loved ones to narratively useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is the  something that Square-Enix used to be good at. &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crono#Crono&quot;&gt;Crono&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerith_Gainsborough&quot;&gt;Aerith&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, both die at certain points where it is narratively useful but also allow for the plots of both games to absorb the shock of a playable character dying and to heal around that point. Mind you in the case of non party based games it would be impossible to confront true death without needless metaphysical intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that hunting season on playable characters never seemed to open up all that much. In fact it seems to have closed altogether since the introduction of voice actors and in my opinion this is probably the worst thing to happen to the narrative quality of games with the exception of the financial success of Popcap. I am not saying that every game should kill off a playable character in the first act but there are some great stories that could be written, that do not exist right now, if this was a more often used option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-then-else&quot;&gt;If, Then, Else&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the few things that I think Valve does not utilize in their work is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.1337philosophxorz.com/2010/07/22/the-citizen-kane-of-video-games/&quot;&gt;active conditional narrative storytelling which I touched on in the first article&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Half Life&lt;/em&gt; series seems to suffer from the ‘long corridor’ syndrome of most video games which would be fine if it were making a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy&quot; title=&quot;Now you are just depressing me&quot;&gt;Tolstoyan&lt;/a&gt; type game that had very idea of the ‘long corridor’ integrated into the moral of the tale.  Otherwise being stuck on the rails of particular plot is very noticeable in video games because the limits of the invisible walls goes against the normal limits of reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that they ignored conditionality completely. Again, it was appropriated by Alyx and according to Valve she adapts to your playing style so there is a certain perception of the incalculable that we would have in our real relationships. Now Alyx is not really incalculable. In fact she is ridiculously calculable but the illusion is there within her algorithms. I believe that Valve called this “personality code”. If this idea, and hopefully the code as well, could be ported towards how the plot unfolds then there would be a real victory for active character development which I honestly think would open the flood gates for the medium as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-world-as-a-stage&quot;&gt;The World as a Stage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Half Life 2&lt;/em&gt; world is also worth noting and from the commentary tracks you get the sense of how much care that Half Life team puts into the vistas their games provide. In fact the most interesting bit in the commentaries is how much work they have done in order to draw the attention to the player to particular events happening around the sets in the games and their use of large landmarks for narrative purposes is also impressive. If you have not played through the episodes with the commentary tracks then you are really missing something in the art direction required for set design in a world where the Camera is unhinged. In fact some of the tricks that I found in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Good_%26_Evil&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond Good and Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were used in &lt;em&gt;Half Life&lt;/em&gt; I think the direction would be near perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting, however, is not merely how things look but also the narrative of the world itself and in the &lt;em&gt;Half Life&lt;/em&gt; world is one of the better examples. Mind you, as I stated before, there is some heavy borrowing from Orwell, and some &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton&quot; title=&quot;Sigh, He wrote Jurassic Park&quot;&gt;Michael Crichton&lt;/a&gt; but it is still a strong enough set of ideas to stand up on their own. Which is fairly important not simply because of the standard “what are the stakes” questions that creative executives like to talk about but more because if narrative conditionality ever takes off the setting will become the natural limits of the plot and keep writers sane. Essentially conditional narrative would make the plot more fluid and the setting would have to act a container and the plot would obviously be limited to the shape of that container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;and-are-we-but-players&quot;&gt;And Are We but Players?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;em&gt;Half Life 2&lt;/em&gt; series as a mirror for my reflections on Video Games are am no longer entirely convinced that what video games, as an art, needs is a Citizen Kane. In fact I think the medium is dire need of an Iliad and despite the fact that Valve has done a great deal for the conventions and grammar they still fall a little short of such a work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that I say that &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; is a story that can only be shown there is still a long tradition of western passive narrative conventions for it to feed upon, hence my claiming it to be Faust with just enough Freud to make it seem more modern, but in active storytelling I am beginning to feel that we are a little bit lost. The ‘long corridor’ is more detrimental to stories than it is in the more traditional mediums. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy X&lt;/em&gt;, artlessly, tried to copy the whole rosebud thing for about ninety percent of the plot and it quite simply did not work. We play games but we are not told games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is why there needs to be a something of an &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; for the medium. The &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are the prototypes for all western fiction. Go and read a non western influenced book like the epic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gilgamesh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll wait — see didn’t that feel odd. Doesn’t quite jive with our expectations of how a story should work and that is even with the aid of translation. Now go out and read Homer’s work. I’ll wait — see much better, right? Even with a few glaring anachronisms. Homer’s work has most of the ingredients that are necessary to construct a good a story and it could be said that all authors, in the western tradition, live in Homer’s shadow. Much as most philosophers live in Socrates’ shadow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past artists have always been working with new forms of grammar and style to mimic the ideas and concepts hidden in the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; to varying success but the one fall back was that each author could behave as narrator of the story. The problem with an active medium, like video games, is that we have to venture away from Homer himself. The narrator is causing problems because it is in competition with another narrator. That of the player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, the word hypocrite comes from an old word for actor. The intended meaning was that the actor’s ability to judge , critic, was underneath the play itself. They were restrained by the plot and everything else despite being artists in their own regards. Now this is true of all artists, a painter can only paint with materials available to him for instance, but the audience was never supposed to be aware of this. This is a problem for a video game player because we are the intended audience and yet we are asked to take on some of the roles of an artist. To be dragged along by the plot is not a good feeling, something Valve discovered early with Alyx Vance’s script, and all the fights between actors, directors, and writers can easily illustrate that point. Even given this the guiding hand of narrator can have a soft touch and Valve is particularly good at this but I am still forced to asked is this necessarily what we want? Will always be the task of the writers to hide the narrator as much as possible? Will video games always be necessarily fatalistic due to the demands of western narrative conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Homer never had a problem with the fates. He and Tolstoy would have gotten along famously. Achilles fate was sealed long before the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; even begun and we a constantly reminded of that fact through the epic but in today’s age where our culture swirls along the ideas of freedom, social mobility, and choice I don’t think that, without a specific artistic reason, that we should be reflecting Homeradic themes on fate even if its merely unintentional due to requirements of the audience as an actor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my, less than humble, opinion a games goal should make the audience hypercritical and emphasis choice and judgement. Even if the choices, actual choices that have mutual exclusivity and each have pros and cons, do lead you down remarkably different paths the difference between these paths could be the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to rewrite the &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; with this in mind we could simply allow Achilles to chose to go to war to win glory or to chose to stay home and live a long life. The difference between these lives could be the very point of the Iliad and to be hones it already is. The &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; constantly contrasts the peaceful pastural life with the horrors of war. This is part of the reason it endures to today. The &lt;em&gt;Iliad&lt;/em&gt; is not just a tale of war but it is really more the tale of both war and peace and I think it makes us decide on what we want out of life. A world where fathers bury their sons or a world where we die old in our beds surround by our progeny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Video games need to stop being about a particular plot. They need to stop being stories about unique individuals making specific choices. The art form needs a tale that is about what we are, and what we want to be, through our very choices.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Endless Nightmare from Which I Cannot Wake: Gay Marriage edition</title>

   <id>/2011/01/14/the-endless-nightmare-from-which-i-cannot-wake-gay-marriage-edition</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;I really didn’t want to talk about this –- ever.  I am dead serious. The main reason for my hesitance is because I got myself embroiled in this debate during my undergraduate and hated every god forsaken minute of it. The conservatives always pushed for something incredibly stupid and the more left winged self righteous would sit on the fence and talk about human rights. The two sides would just reenact their own version of the Somme spitting venom at each other. I tried, then, to have an honest discussion on this topic at the time and I was just left bloody and quite lifeless in No Man’s land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic was same-sex marriage and I thought I was done with this shit in 2004. Canada did something about it via the most polite method possible;  out of deference to Canadian traditions.  Then the prop 8 shit bubbled up and for a second time we were sent back into the trenches. This time, because it was American, it had higher production values and far less polite. Again, I got stuck trying to be reasonable and ended up corpse in No Man’s land once more. Despite the fact that my argument was more lucid and well developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2010 it was the Argentine government that legalised gay marriage right before Judge Walker’s decision on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_v._Schwarzenegger&quot;&gt;Perry vs. Schwarzenegger&lt;/a&gt;. This time the debate was very much on the pro side of things but for what reason. I know only of two people that have read the full &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/files/09cv2292-ORDER.pdf&quot;&gt;Perry vs. Schwarzenegger ruling&lt;/a&gt; and even less people that are versed in Argentine law but all the people that I have chosen to associate myself with said that these were great victories. There was no thought. There was no discussion that mistakes could have been made. There was just the people that read the top 100 words of some blog or tumblr account and looked at me askance because I was not hip hip hooraying before even finishing the first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now its 2011 and the Canadians have returned to their polite traditions in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/prairies/same-sex-nuptials-cant-be-refused-on-religious-grounds-saskatchewan-court-rules/article1863987/&quot;&gt;an attempt to scale back this whole gay marriage thing&lt;/a&gt; and based on the news outlets on the matter I sincerely doubt that any thought will come out of this round of discussion. So now I am pissed off just because I have been hearing the same things for 6 years and I am tired. So this time I am putting in print just so when the next round comes up I can just post a link.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let slip the dogs of &lt;em&gt;frisson&lt;/em&gt; commentors and let me sink into the muck once again. Hopefully this time around the final shot might at least leave an up stretched arm, entangled in razor wire, with a cliched butterfly landing on my lifeless right pointer finger. Hopefully in sepia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-the-beginning&quot;&gt;In The Beginning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first myth I must dispense with is that marriage has not always carried the same meaning. This love and marriage being hitched together is not a tradition. Sure everyone was in agreement that it would be nice if you loved your wife or husband but it was hardly necessary and in some cases it could be a bit much.&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompey#Caesar_and_the_First_Triumvirate&quot;&gt;Pompey was mocked for spending far to much to time with his wife&lt;/a&gt; and not enough time with boys. The institution was simply not designed to handle love in any modern capacity or even in an ancient one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What was the goal?” I hear rattling around there in future perfect land. Well the goal was to simply to protect patriarchal family lines and property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very easy, for obvious reasons, to identify maternal lines but it was very difficult to make 100% sure who the father is unless you happen to have DNA testing;  which most ancient societies were having a bit of trouble perfecting. This is further complicated, as far as the state is concerned, when they started to link property rights and caste rights to the male side of the society. So a somewhat clever solution is devise the marriage contract to make it easier for the state to make certain to which male is legitimate heir to their father’s empire and status in an official capacity. This is also the reason why there is a fairly common cultural lietmotif about women not being loyal to their husbands as being particularly scandalous, or the man being particularly stupid/naïve, whereas the opposite seems to be a matter of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;they-werent-called-dark-because-they-ran-out-of-candles&quot;&gt;They Weren’t Called Dark Because They Ran Out of Candles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does any of the above have any relevance to the modern context? Yes and no. The problem is that the legal context of marriage is still set up with the above ideas in mind. The law does not care about the current more emotional context that has something to do with love springing eternal that is so popular with the young kids these days. By these days I mean since the late middle ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between massacring a much more civilized culture, not bathing, and believing in &lt;a href=&quot;http://engineerofknowledge.blogspot.com/2010/03/first-crusade-accounts-of-eyewitnesses.html&amp;quot;sorry the only online source I could find&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;divine poultry&lt;/a&gt; the Europeans developed a taste for Romance stories. Knights winning a lady’s hand and finding as true a corporeal love as perfect as their love with god(cough). These are merely cute stories to amuse the gentry and to make up bad pick up lines for the age. Remember the same stories have giants, dragons and what not. More or less fantastical reflections of the Norman feudal power structures and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stories were never supposed to have anything to do with reality; which can be seen directly in the very madness of Don Quixote.(For those that have not read this book, in short, he was driven mad because he fell in love with a women below his station and read to much of the this Green knight and Lancelot shit so he created a rather elaborate fantasy to support this need for perfect love. For the rest of the book he is beaten senseless with alarming frequency) Further more the lesser classes were considered to have a less gentile version of love. I once came across a guide on how to have sex with that desirable serf which invades your dreams – they seem to to like being taken from behind against a tree or shrubbery. No need for chit chat or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite all the rhetoric put together by the best spoony bards of the day if you start to read these texts carefully it begins to become apparent that they are more about the caste system of Europe than having anything to do with an essential definition of love. Think of any the standard plot twist where a knight falls in love with some lowly serf, or some other sort of peasant, only to find out that said object of affection is actually of the same station, or higher, but was switched at birth. After all the bards could not offend their paying audience.﻿&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;let-them-eat-wedding-cake&quot;&gt;Let Them Eat (Wedding) Cake&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The middle age culture is important because as the merchant classes started demanding that everyone to be considered as equal citizens; as long as they were male and owned land but this would change to be more inclusive overtime. They did not, however, want to lower the nobles to them, or return them to a natural state as some of the enlightenment cats would put it, but rather elevate themselves to nobility. This made the bourgeoisie aristocratic in a fashion. They, and by they I mean we at this particular juncture point in history, became the heirs of all their bullshit and tried our best to emulate them despite not having the various other tiers of humanity to supported such a silly system. Which leads to the new problem of modern marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now mind you, if only the nobles got married then it would be a nice a small system that only a few families would have, or even need, the appropriate paperwork. When the modern romantic writers (looking at you Goethe!) came around they did their best to expand the mythos so that everybody could fall in love with this divine carnal other. Yay! Still this was merely a first attempt and Goethe was being held back by the two facts that his society did not have a particular grasp on the whole idea behind irony and much of it was illiterate anyway. The final nail for the social meaning to resemble the traditional legal model came in the early twentieth century with new mass media like the cinema and radio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two delivery platforms were truly democratic ways of telling stories. No education required and when that was coupled with Hollywood, and Hollywood specifically, censor codes it had the ability to shape an entire generation desire a particular narrative for their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the descendants of various puritans, a rather boring bunch with the exception of Milton, decided that it was inappropriate to discuss sex in the cinema. Actually, come to think of it,  I am pretty sure that they did not want to discuss sex at all but the cinema is really the only thing pertinent here. The censors codes were put there to protect the moral fibre of those puritans. This was a particularly stupid decision because writers are known for being clever and censors are known for being stupid. One of the lesser known truisms of history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not everything is like the end of North By Northwest or fretting about &lt;a href=&quot;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080529/REVIEWS08/925898329/1023&quot;&gt;Godfrey’s buttons&lt;/a&gt; but that will get you up to speed on what could easily be slipped past censors. The problem is this could easily be slipped by children as well. The happy ending where there is a wedding, which in the writers, and the majority of the ﻿contemporaneous audiences minds, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ71iwFhry8&amp;amp;t=10m7s&quot;&gt;meant &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;sex&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; became the expression of eternal love - which is not only sexless but necessarily sexless because the message got passed the censors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how we got confused and this started an entire generation to be searching for this eternal search as a cultural ethos. Not just eternal love but eternal heterosexual monogamous love because that was the only thing the censors would approve. And of course the ultimate expression of that is big elegantly produced white wedding. Nothing could be more Hollywood than the big wedding. Its a good way to fill up the screen with activity and everybody loves of wedding because there is a lot of movement on screen. It is the cinematic equivalent of jingling your keys in front of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even I fall victim to these types of thoughts despite being perfectly aware of what is kicking about in the superego. Just think how often you end up really liking someone and maybe even loving them but are having a hard time switching gears into a more lecherous mode which is necessary to maintain a real healthy relationship. Or worse yet when &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166198/&quot; title=&quot;The Fountain of Youth&quot;&gt;I come to my own home, at midnight, and take it as an injury&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily there is always a well stocked liquor cabinet in the places I call home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-vesting-power&quot;&gt;The Vesting Power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is particularly problematic for each individual. I can get over my sexless romantic issues with some ease. I shouldn’t really have to but it is simple to over ride such instructions produced by the &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; (this is an inferior translation of the Heideggerian &lt;em&gt;Das Mann&lt;/em&gt; with a bit of Freudian Superego mixed in). Sure it can be a little traumatic and usually we associate the overcoming of this trauma as a symptom of growing up. Which, as an aside, should show that the model of our stories as nurturing and productive fables obviously have something wrong with them if they run counter to us being productive adults. Make up new stories damn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is more of a imposition on the state. I don’t really think any of us think that the odd collection of bureaucracy and lawyers that make up the administrative side of any government’s marriage system really care whether or not the interested parties are in love. At least I don’t rationally believe this and I don’t think anyone else does because at all the weddings I have attended I have never seen the charming clerk that gave the happy couple the form to register for the happy event. Then again most happy couples that I know seem to be a little on a rude side. I am &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; waiting on my thank you cards people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, the state considers marriage as much as it was originally formulated. This is why there are those peculiar laws governing citizenship. Marry someone and they instantly become what you are. Why? Well because then the resulting child would obviously have to be a citizen in same type as the parents. There is still no real way of saying that you are half a citizen of somewhere. The binary is still either you are not a citizen or you are. The recent trick is to allow for dual citizenship which is the legal codes nod to quantum physics. You are what you are observed as at a particular moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still the reason for the binary is because of the way the Nation-State is trying to work through it constitutional issues. If all people born within its borders are forever more to be citizens of the great then it would have to stand to reason that one of the easier ways to track this would be through the marriage system. Not only that but since the Nation-State requires eternal existence it would also be prudent that to bribe (the tax cuts that usually accompany the marriage contract) those that will have children with in the watchful eye of the state and by approval of the state parameters as to what it wants to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example would be the fact that most countries, or whatever body gets to define marriage, – I think each state in United States of America gets to do this which I find ontologically confusing but I will leave that for another day – usually disapprove of inbreeding for rather obvious reasons but if a brother and sister wanted to marry when they are post-reproductively useful, the state would still intercede and say that they could not marry. Which does not make sense if marriage was not solely, or at least the major function, was about the creation of new little bulbous citizens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only reason for this is because the state considers marriage to be a way to manage the children that keep appearing after people shack up. This is also why gay marriage did not come up as an issue until it was forced. The state didn’t care. By state I mean the functionaries of the administrative side of marriage. The corrective force of nationhood may, has, and does care about sexuality for other, not entirely unrelated, reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the main problem that the state takes, notice I did not say politicians, issue with the whole gay marriage thing. There is nothing other than an administrative headache, for those civil servants that have to deal with it, and beyond that a cost to the entire citizenry with no added benefit to the state. Sure some singular people may be happier about their status but is it worth the headache of watching all the marriages and divorces when it does not pertain to the state at all. It is my opinion that it is not worth the pain and suffering to start putting more strain on an already overtaxed system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still the problem chief problem with our current marriage system is not entirely that homosexual couples want enter into marital bliss. The real problem is that divorce rates are ridiculously high for system that is not designed to deal with divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Divorce was supposed to be function as a weird exception to cover infidelity and few other problems. Now it is a fix for circa 50% of marriages that occur which is the reason no fault divorce came into most legal codes in the latter half of the last century. It was put there to make the administration of these divorces easier and not to make people feel better. Mind you this action was like putting a bandaid on femoral arterial bleed but still it was at least an acknowledgement that something was wrong. Gay marriage would be like ripping the bandaid off really, really, slowly so that you can feel every hair being pulled out one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure the administrational problem of dealing with another 10% of any regional population wanting to intermarry would not be a huge undertaking and I doubt anyone has noticed that much more paper work in countries where gay marriage is legal – well, yet anyway because most of these countries have a sample group of little over a decade at the most. The problem that I foresee coming is that the marriage system will eventually collapse as divorce rates and remarrying rates rise. This will put enough pressure that the budgetary concerns, especially for those governments that claim to be fiscally frugal, running such a department will become financially unreasonable. Still, I would like to repeat, it is mainly heterosexual divorce that is causing the problems but adding homosexual marriage and divorce is just not helping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be the straw that broke the camels back and my worry is that it will be blamed for the collapse. There will be a simple causal link. Gay marriage introduced and 10 years latter the marriage system becomes to cumbersome for the state to handle. The simple causal link would be false of course and only be as accurate as saying that the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was the cause for the first world war but then again I see that lazy type of research in a lot of high school history books so it is not like my concern is unjustified.  This would be the last thing needed for the gay rights and acceptance movement needs. In fact I think it would set the whole thing back by decades of hard won victories but &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecf.cand.uscourts.gov/cand/09cv2292/files/09cv2292-ORDER.pdf&quot;&gt;at least some people will feel better when walking into a bank(p.12)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;i-am-the-law&quot;&gt;I Am the Law&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fine, some of you may have noticed that I do not care that much about people’s feelings. I trample on lots of people’s feelings everyday and I hope some of you reading this are vaguely insulted by me. At least some of you might have to think while writing your angry comment but I don’t think feelings are a good measure for a legal system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good example of this being a bad idea is what happened in Quebec’s language laws. The Québécois, again for the latter part of the last century, became increasing cranky about what they observed as cultural erosion caused by the vast majority of English speakers in the rest of the country. This is an irrational fear to a certain degree but it is a fairly average and normal fear so I am willing to entertain it. The problem is that their solution to the problem was not the best. They simply made English signs illegal. Okay fine it is not très difficle to make out French signs when floating about Montréal so I have no particular issue with this aspect but because this was proposed legally a particular brand of legal stupidity arose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the case of the arrêt sign. For those of you that don’t speak french, arrêt simply means stop and yes they have bothered to translate stop on the trusty old octagon. I honestly would not have cared if I had not been to a great many different places on Earth and have noticed the presence of stop signs in many other countries like Greece and Greece does not even bother with the Latin alphabet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a lament on a culture of opportunism, although I am willing to bet that the arrêt sign was designed as an opportunistic as an effect of the irrational law, or the stupidity of the Québécois as a people; maybe the lawyers a little and the politicians. It is merely an way to show you what the law actually is, dear reader. It is a weapon and it must be a razor sharp weapon that is very precise. Otherwise you may end up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJiYrRcfQo&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and to be honest this is the level of apparent intelligence that happens with these laws that are not particularly sharp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear that this is what is happening with marital law lately. Just by adding things with no apparent reason creates this huge bludgeoning weapon that can in fact have consequences far beyond the intended. I.e. Immigration, adoption, taxation, and so on and so forth. It is true that this love garbage is the most irrational thing I can fathom but still shouldn’t that be an argument against the government having any amount of power over such a dominion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel, in the most ironic way possible, that the politicians have to write a new draft on the purpose of marriage as it pertains to the state which as I have stated should surround the idea of children given the way the nation-state excuses its ‘possession’ of a citizenry. To be clear this should not be done to exclude gay marriage at all. In fact it should be done in such a way to promote the inheritance lines of adoptive children and give tax breaks to only those that raise children. Meaning that couples that live together and have happy lives without the need of the ankle biters ruining a perfectly romantic situation will not get the added tax benefit as well as being happy. You shouldn’t be allowed to have everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure that means that the parliament will have to say some unpopular things like “We don’t care about love” and that they would be quite frankly be bribing people to have children ; they are already in the practice but they are not frank about it. A small price to pay honestly because the administration of marriage will be much easier it was just a rider programme attached to birth certificate or adoption papers thus saving the government a great deal of money on maintaining an autonomous department for this marital system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would not stop anyone from having a religious ceremony or having a party where everyone drinks to much and notices that the familial resemblance of arhythmic gyrating but it just wouldn’t be a bother to the state. I have many parties that I don’t tell the Canadian government about and some of those parties are more fun that any wedding I have attended but the spread is usually worse. I think that has more to do with my mediocre tax bracket rather than me not getting married.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure it will be a new modern system for a new modern age but I don’t see why that is so frightening. That is more or less what is asked by the gay rights movement but please let us do it smartly. Shallow and hollow victories are annoying and they never do anything substantially positive. It just decent public relations. It is this case it might be better that the government does not relate to the public but rather do something beneficial as members of the public. In fact they should do that all the time but I have long ago learnt to abandon my dreams. Hopefully I will not live to the day that customs officials have &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri#The_Inferno&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch’intrate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; above their little nooks but luckily I don’t think I will have to live to the age of hyperbole.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fools and Money</title>
   <link href="/2010/07/23/fools-and-money/"/>
   <updated>2010-07-23T03:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2010/07/23/fools-and-money</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;After a particularly long night out on the town, I was smoking under a lamppost outside of one of late night downtown haunts. Looking very l’homme fatal, I saw a man I knew going up to people and asking for change. I do not really know him but his turf seems to be around my own. Occasionally he even asks me. Depending on my mood I may give it to him. This is normally not something I would comment on but for the first time I noticed something calculated about his actions. He seemed to know, with reasonable accuracy, which people were willing to give him a bit of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This struck me as odd. I have always had a problem with identifying meaningful character traits without chatting someone up but this man could simply tell generosity from a brief look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has had problems with me. I had always thought of him as particularly bad at his profession. I assumed he was just buckshoting to scrape out money to keep himself in tolerable above ground existence. It turns out that I was the problem in the relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He zoomed passed me without much of a glance. Which was wise, considering I was in a very sour mood, but just past me there was a couple kissing and taking the occasional break for air and to gaze deeply into each others eyes. Neither of them were particularly well dressed to demarcate wealth but despite this the man went straight up to them and asked for some money for {insert reason}. Stranger still, the girl took a five out of her ridiculously small purse and gave it to him. He shuffled a little down the street and found a drunk man holding onto a wall for dear life. I think I saw the glint of silver and brass so he must have scored a twoonie out of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is how he went down the street. I counted and he managed to get 4 out of 5 people he asked. The odd man out may have wanted to give him something but ended up throwing up into the gutter and the homeless man moved away in disgust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched what looked like a young professional wretch up about half a weeks paycheque into the storm drain. While the young turk type was checking the drain to make sure his shoes had not come out through his mouth, I began to think that homeless was clearly the wrong term for a man that could so easily navigate his way through the chaos of 3:30 am Halifax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This man is merely, to steal from George Carlin, houseless. His home is Halifax circa final call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every drunk he picked clean responded in the same way a desk drawer responds to me in my office area. He knew total strangers the way I know furniture and the way some know family and pets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of man is not some romantic vagrant. He is obviously suffering. His clothes never change. He always carries a bit of a smell and his eyes glint of something that could not possibly be natural. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is like the grotesque, high atop gothic buildings, that offset the prim and proper of the south end. He is their opposite but still knows the culture of the land. Yet I still get the impression that he is more at home in Halifax than the Uncommon Grounds yogi set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He fulfilled a niché in the city the same way that anyone would when an appropriate environment is available . That does not make him a freak or a mutant but it makes him a true Haligonian. Truer than most because at least he is in sync with the cultural tableau. Which is something that I will never achieve. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Ancora Imparo</title>
   <link href="/2010/07/23/ancora-imparo/"/>
   <updated>2010-07-23T02:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2010/07/23/ancora-imparo</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;When you wake up in the morning there is an impulse to look back over the previous day and look for omens and portents. At least this is how I feel when I am staring at the ceiling from a lonely bed. I normally resist these urges but yesterday was a bit of a different type of day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with a day off from the soul sucking fluorescent tubes - this is how they are powered right? - to attend the convocation of two friends. I wore my standard attire with a blazer draped over my unimpressive shoulders. They wore gowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graduation ceremony was basically the same as my own. Families gathered, brimming with pride, and the students oscillating between happy, sad, and nervous. I thought it was not going to affect me. I really did. I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my eldest friend, who we will name Spock to preserve some of his anonymity, went to get his degree he ended up crying and hugged the dean of the university. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was taken aback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I barely reacted to getting my own slip of paper and have been lost, rudderless, in an ocean of confusion ever since. But here was a man that reacted to all this lead up to his calling. This confused me and I dwelled on it during the day as I spent in it my usual way. Reading philosophy in order to figure out a question I developed in my undergrad which still consumes what remains of my soul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner and a disco-nap I went out to meet Spock for coffee. We had scheduled dancing and drinking to celebrate his trot past the finish line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over coffee I asked outright “Why the breakdown?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t breakdown. I just did what felt right. You should try that occasionally.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually the sage-like wisdom is flowing in the other direction in this relationship. The little train on the second track of my mind started visiting all the old stations of my path to this place while the train on the primary track did the usual talking about nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got kicked out of the café at closing time and proceeded to head downtown. Back to Tribeca. It was his choice this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, arriving later than I arrived last week, the club was already starting to upswing. There was some nervous dancing and people drifting like tumbleweeds between the bar and groups of friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the first drink we both decided to hit the dance floor. Specifically because Abba’s Dancing Queen came on and he is the follower of the Great Religion of Abba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish that was a clever euphemism but honestly it’s not. His patron saints include, Judy Garland, Cher, and Barbara Streisand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite him being my closest friend I still won’t dance with him because I am pretty sure that would scorch any remote chance of having feminine company on the way home. On the plus side he did find some friends to dance with amongst the nervous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was doing my usual thing of dancing in a reserved manner. The music was the same as usual and it was not very busy but then suddenly the Djs started to spin Bel Biv DeVoe’s Poison and the train on that second track of my mind derailed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I went off to boarding school, and was completely stripped of privacy, I used to watch Much Music and do that type of bedroom dancing that you only do when you think no one is watching. This song may as well have been Alan Bates turning to me, in his white suit, and saying “Zorba, teach me to dance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stick rattled down my spine and out of my butt. All those years of arrhythmia melted and I was dancing for fun. There was no object to the dance. This was just for fun. The fact that I didn’t care what other people thought of me was helping and I may have even been smiling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was stranger still was that even though I was not aiming at anyone I was gaining traction on the dance-floor. Girls were paying attention to me and were even dancing with me by their own manoeuvres and not mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind, which was very sober, turned to the Origins of Inequality and the thought that maybe we started dancing just because we were innocent and bored. Then I quickly dismissed it because I really &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; hate Rousseau and I am hardly innocent by this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I caught a look on Spock’s face and he was a little confused as to what was going on with me? To be fair so was I. Why would my childhood self attract more positive attention than what has survived to adulthood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The night obviously didn’t end in some hook up but I was still happy if not a little bit sweaty. All the girls I was dancing with got dragged off by friends and each one left with an odd shy wave on their part. I have never actually seen this behaviour before and I have no idea what it means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found something deep within me that I had been ignoring during my darker years. It is odd that a man, who had just been called, knows more about how to be happy and how to listen to those old ontologies. These prison cells, that I have locked away a great deal of my past, seem to be holding wise people. These former selves seem to know what joy is. I am still learning.&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A little while ago they got ‘round to throwing me out. I caught some decent hangtime before crashing into the streetless abyss. The only problem is that the lion scratches and unicorn hoof impacts had left deep discolouring scars that will never vanish. I may not be as I look but they no longer care and neither do I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I awoke to the sudden application of faint whisper, the type of whisper that is like a sledgehammer to the temple, that I am “Doing it wrong!” Looking around my bedroom there was nothing that could have stirred me from my slumber but now I was awake and nothing could be done about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cell phone informed me that is was around eight in the evening and my stomach informed me that breakfast was twelve hours ago. Consuming a hastily cooked meal of ratatouille I fleetingly glanced at at the remnants of a once proud liqueur display and found myself making eye contact with Morgan. Could it be he that told me of my gaucheness? Despite the fact that fate was in his ancestry I had my doubts but left my right eyebrow to remain suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Groping through desk drawers for matches I examined the status of my friends through the bled light of the ether. One was eating a muffin, another had not let out an ethereal vibration for at least a week and I am beginning to assume that he has either become involved with a woman or is dead, and the other go-to was doing not much of anything but suffers from occasional bouts of symposiaphobia and planned a nice night in with a book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contemplating this I stuck my match and allowed my face to be naturally lit before consumed by a cloud of smoke. It was only 10:30. Despite this I ventured towards the piers of Halifax where broken men belong. Am I broken? I can sense no break. They may.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before dropping into the harbour I pushed my self through the cacophonic melody of Friday night. Is there live music? Decent D.J.? Available Women? Men? Men and Women? The leitmotif that I have observed in almost every edge of the western world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for the evening was to make it to Tribeca just before Sackville drops into the harbour. I am always fond of the mythological New York and this bar delivers a small sliver of that. One day I hope to meet a Dotty Parker and a have chat over exactly four martinis. Merely fantasy but I hope she keeps her glasses on. The real reason I keep returning is because of music. Which is not typical fanfare allows me to put on my red shoes and dance arrhythmically - after a few restoratives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My chronic arrhythmia is deeply in tune with city. Tribeca was occupied by a full staff that were relaxed, one of the regulars, a few crickets too bored to even chirp. This is not woeful because I would be able to get a quiet drink in before the complete saturation tequila vapour and pheromones. Eye of the hurricane. After the Heineken fused with blood the wind will pick up and you can Marry Poppins with your umbrella. The only way to fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wind began to howl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the third beer I needed to fumigate my lungs. The conversation outside had turned to that pesky Canadian habit of offering to buy cigarettes off people. There were divided opinions on the matter and kept to myself finding it be like an amusing but banal radio talk show. The cigarette began to fizzle out and I laced up the red shoes and moved on in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dance floors always shimmer like the surface of the sun. It seems chaotic but it is by which we can see each other. Beauty is not in the intense mass of limbic foam but in the movement of the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My pulsing didn’t seem to attract much attention but I am used to this because I am unsure how to dance without a partner and my knee had some minor damage done to it recently. The beer had taken the pain away and saved it for about four in the morning - when I could really use it. This is when something happened that has not happened in a while. A girl gave me a come hither stare accompanied by a beckoning finger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was immensely flattered as the only female I would call a friend is deeply sapphic and in a very monogamous relationship. I started to dance with here and she seemed drunker than me but not completely out of it. The dance became increasingly intense. Suddenly there were lips upon mine and I was gently dragging my slight overbite over her lower-lip. There was strange sensation of Jägermiester. Pride’s sails at full bellows. I did not take the warning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We slowly moved off to the side of the dance floor to make out in earnest while dancing. Two events made me realize things had turned to the strange. The first was that she licked the side of my cheek – this may be strange but I have known women that do this without severe intoxication and always found it a to make it me feel like some sort of lion cub almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Simba. Reality came down like a Hydrogen Bomb just before I could think about how to extract myself in polite way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Free from imagined sexual repression she processed to dry hump my bad knee. The room got darker as my eyes focused to the bright light of the Valkyrie. The shrieking goddesses consumed every cubic inch of my headspace and lit my alcohol infused blood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was not very drunk or just a little tipsy but there was no way to think straight and quickly. Just a fusion of different sopranos shrieking in my ears and a thump of a second heart in my leg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to get her to switch legs but then she lent back and nearly tumbled over causing me to hug her just to keep her from taking an spill. She took this another way. Some grabbing and fumbling I managed to look into her eyes in way that my friends call the ‘soul stare’ and find uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just me looking into someone to see if the hamster is still running. The poor creature had died of alcohol poising or, as someone else has pointed out, bit of date rape at the bar. There was very little grey and white matter going with any earnest processing and what was left had a particular idea of how the evening should end despite physical impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest problem was that I had no idea whom this woman was or whom her friends may be. I could barely keep her standing and had lost any semblance of control of the situation - if I ever had it. Oddly, I kept up the facade of dance because I could not think of better plan. All that was in my mind was constant shrieking. I looked around shrugging a bit which everyone seemed to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things were getting out of hand and fast. Suddenly, seemingly out of poof of smoke and a kazahn, another women appeared. She wore the type of disapproving look that you normally associate with some sort of judge and she seemed to stand there for a few minutes for my time dilated perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After those few minutes of confusion and arm flailing she, the magical woman, leaned into my ear and said “I’m her friend and we are going to take her home.” Apparently she was one of the pride. The change in number without visual evidence confused me. She was standing alone. How could she become a we so fast? Had pentagrams been drawn? Ninjas from the roof? Was she Queen Victoria? Had time, space, and meaning collapsed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with all those half thoughts swirling in my mind I responded “Thank God.” This seemed to leave a bit of quizzical expression on her – amongst the scorn of course. This is about when the dancer fell over again. I caught her for the last time and two of her other friends, the rest of the pride I assumed, filed out of the crowd and there was a transfer. Also I think her blouse may have fallen down a bit leaving her exposing her bra because I have this faint impression of someone correcting shirt straps. This woman had ceased to be sexual object a while a go and become a strange problem so I wasn’t really looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I backed against a wall a put all my weight on the right leg. The screaming shut up in my head and I could think again. The scene next to me was not pretty. The dancer wanted to keep dancing and there was strange malaise of an argument. The argument ended with her passing out on her feet. Her two friends started carrying her like one of the fresher corpses from no man’s land after a World War One battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt more than one dirty look upon me but I didn’t care. I through that little bit of vanity and pride on the dance floor to be trampled and returned to bar for a beer to get the taste of Jäger out of my mouth and to look for place to sit and let the beer clear out the pain in my leg so I could eventually walk up the Sackville drop home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to finish this new beer quickly. Some new people appeared around me and one sorry-son-a-bitch looked a lot like me. This was noticed by the group and one quickly asked for my label. “Gui Raymond” I managed to croak out. Surprise crept over the crowd and I thought I may have said something else. Turns out that the sorry-son-of-a-bitch had the similar name and this was deeply interesting to the drunk but not to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was interesting was that last call was about a quarter of an hour away. My beer finished and my second heart was still beating. I excused myself from the group and went to the bar to close out my tab with just one last restorative and sat down in one of the expatriated car seats nearer to the exit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the woman that collects the cover charge there doing that thing you do when you are bored to tears. Fiddling with her blackberry. I chatted with her as a bit of distraction. The short version of the conversation was that she is off to med school and wondering about what the next few years had in store. I told her some of the more amusing stories from a group of doctors that I used to run around with and mused over the fact that self-circumcision is much more common in the ER than anyone expects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last call rang and I went outside to smoke and allow some time for the full effect of my medicine. Chatting with the more amusing came naturally. I wrote something in my notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at it now it is just an old joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Physicist: My paper is done unless it’s observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would I want to write that lame joke down at such a point? Mind my mind was trying to pull something from the darker corners but at this point I was no longer tipsy but drunk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pride of lionesses had reappeared and were giving me something that I perceived as a funny look while I was chatting with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The look reminded me a confused crow but I stopped reading passages of forgotten lore when I left classics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragging my shambling corpse up that fucking hill is not my favourite activity even when I am in good condition. That night was no exception but there was something of idea bubbling around. ‘Nolle prosequi’ repeated over and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a bit of useless prat it should be of no surprise that upon stepping my bedroom I got sure footing on the dustcover of some hardcover I was reading and did a great backwards fall into the nothingness. I found that laughter had filled the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was smiling. I didn’t and don’t know why. I just had the thought that this generation is somehow quantum in its constitution. Existing in strange probability fields that once observed you became static but how you got there was a mystery. The fear doesn’t seem to be about social standing but that one’s ontology may shift to what they think. That you would become what others saw. So many years the people cried that they were not an object but are they failing as a subject? Is this what has become of the world? To stop moving is to finally be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen X was supposed to be apathetic and overeducated. Is this new generation just afraid to care or to show it? The dancer lioness had so much sexuality bottled up that it just came out as an explosion. A once unique man found his doppelgänger. The pride of lionesses found both a lecherous scumbag and chatty guy about pointless subjects. And a future med student got a peek into the crazy life of residency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People seem to worry about how they will be judged by the jury of strangers except when dangerously drunk. And I have never met a person that did something completely surprising when tanked. Only something that was within them anyway which the old buffer was stopping. Has this generation of Canadians had its constitution drafted by those that know best? Who buys this shit? Who would want to encourage it by not acting out? Have the sixties protests been completely slaughtered by the Wall street yuppies of the eighties? Is everyone that worried about failure that no one even wants to try? And why aren’t the streets full of nauseous people except when then buffer is gone the gaze is goggled? I knew Sartre was full of shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know but I need to find out.” I said aloud to the apartment. It creaked with approval. Striking a match the room took on a nice amber hue for the few seconds but with a wave of the hand it returned to darkness except for a floating bright red bulb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hiatus from the world had been too long. This thing I was returning to is new and different. I wasn’t throwing back in with the thing but I was walking like drunk over cigarette packets around the place. Freaking out because someone may find me attractive. Like some gecko who spies a cat but with a particular brain condition that makes him run towards the cat. I float through the present with a strange surreal zeal. Maybe I am broken but maybe at least, hopefully, interestingly so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I closed the night by exhaling a long column of vaporized coffin nail straight up into the air. Butted out and lay down - knowing full well that my knee alarm would go off in a couple of hours. I slid my eyelids gently over the old corneas and was about to sleep when I heard “You’re doing it wrong”. I threw a pillow in no particular direction and yelled “Fuck off.”&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Final Fantasy Addendum Review</title>
   <link href="/2010/07/22/final-fantasy-addendum-review/"/>
   <updated>2010-07-22T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2010/07/22/final-fantasy-addendum-review</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;I have been playing Final Fantasy since I was a small child. Now it seems that I have been asked by Nietzsche’s Demon / Angle to play every one of these games in endless cycles and I am not sure if I am happy about this or I am going to end up in a pick-up truck yelling &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107048/&quot; title=&quot;Groundhog day&quot;&gt;“don’t drive angry”&lt;/a&gt; to a rodent. Final Fantasy XIII has already been reviewed to death but I have some thoughts that were not in any of the reviews that I have read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The production values are insanely good and by production values I do not exactly mean just the technical aspect of the graphics but a great deal more. I could call it &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_scène&quot; title=&quot;Mise en scène&quot;&gt;mise en scène&lt;/a&gt; but that is an overused term in cinema that is to vague for my purposes. So I will explain the elements that I mean beyond the technical graphical detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first paradoxical thing I would like to address is that the monsters in this game are less monstrous. In every previous game all your encounters with the monstrous are either random or you always got the impression that everything in world was just waiting to kill you or be killed by you. This is a convention that most video games have and can work in certain cases, like in Beyond Good and Evil, but in Final Fantasy it has always been part of the suspension of disbelief. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time around, at least as soon as you get to Gran Pulse – for those that have not played the game it is the large openish world – the monsters or more like animals. Mind you they all seem to be stuck on an loop of a daily routine – possibly confronted by the same Demon/Angle that torments me – but you do get a sense of them fighting for territory, running around in state of play, worshipping treasure chests – okay that was a bit odd – or just searching for food. Even one of the hunt quests says that your quarry, which happens to a large dinosaur like creature - is probably just a lost child looking for its mother – I have yet to complete this quest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of care went into making these creatures animals rather than just obligatory obstacles in your path. Every robot in the game, however, is exactly that. You take a bit of good with the bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The art direction is also well done and for the first time in the series I got a sense of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshitaka_Amano&quot; title=&quot;Yoshitaka Amano&quot;&gt;Amano’s&lt;/a&gt; art style inside the game rather than just between the covers of the manual. It is not omnipresent but it is present in the Cie’th stones and some of the designs of creatures and building. This style is both beautiful and colourful, which to be perfectly honest, most games today look like the inside of the toilet from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951/&quot; title=&quot;Trainspotting&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trainspotting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; out of fear of being considered too childish. It is a nice break to see beautiful sights with the graphical competence of large company like Square-Enix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack is good and far more memorable than the work in Final Fantasy XII but at the same time I find the series has yet to top the work in Final Fantasy VI. In that game each leitmotif is associated with a character and each combination of these to make a song had some purpose to the plot. The soundtrack to Final Fantasy XIII is bit more like a Hollywood movie. Most of the songs are memorable and some are very beautiful but they do not mesh into a coherent whole and are there to act more tone for a part of a narrative rather than helping the narrative along. I feel this is important for video games as an art form because there will always be long stretches of the experience which the music is the primary auditory queue for the narrative. Still it is very well done despite the fact that I did not like the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37FiiCU08_o&quot; title=&quot;My Hands&quot;&gt;Leona Lewis song&lt;/a&gt; which the story seem to want to be hinged on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course the technical aspects of the gameplay elements are fairly well done and do manage to cut down on some tedium and micromanagement which would have been great to allow us to enjoy the story without worrying which of the characters was missing their packed lunch. I will get to why I am using a subjunctive voice in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything isn’t roses and sunshine with the game and a lot of it has to do with the acting and the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The voice acting in the game is variable. It is not fair to say that is is horrible. It is just some of the written lines are so weird that I am not sure any voice actor could have convinced me of sincerity.  Also the choice of making the Gran Pulse accent Australian, Gran Puls being a world that is literally under the world which you start on, has led me to make far to many down under jokes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other problem with the acting is the motion capture kind of oscillates between Kabuki play, or really any type of play, and film acting. The larger gestures just seem odd when the camera is so close to the character. I thought Square-Enix used to do this because they used to keep the camera far back in non-prerendered scenes to hide problems with the textures which would make larger sweeping gesture more necessary. Now this isn’t a problem, which is an achievement in itself, but they still have this strange bad habit. It is also important to note this happens a great deal less in the prerendered cinematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally the plot …. it’s silly. I’m sorry I don’t have much more to say. Group of young people although not as young as usual, Lighting is 21 and just about to take the officers exams before she is dragged into this mess whereas in earlier games she would have probably made the rank of general by then  is famous on the field, save the world.  Essentially it is just like &lt;a href=&quot;http://project-apollo.net/text/rpg.html&quot; title=&quot;JRPG Tropes&quot;&gt;every other JRPG in existence&lt;/a&gt;. Which annoys me because the plot has base components similar to Babylon 5 and with a little bit of work and care the plot could have been really good and may have even had some surprises. Alas, it is not meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest way for me to put it is that it’s Dune except no one tries to play out their roles to absurdly. The entire game is done is somewhat a deadpan serious tone with comic relief sections which seems a little silly given that the plot is just so silly to start with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A for instance in this case would be the charter Dysely. To reference my Dune example, no body wants to play a subtle floating fat man, so go for broke. Dysley should have been overplayed just for amusements sake and it is not like Final Fantasy has not done this before. Kefka, from Final Fantasy VI and Seymour from Final Fantasy X were both of this genre of villain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all I can think of that has not been said ad nauseam by every other human on earth. I would still recommend this game if just to look at and considering how many of you have seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0499549/&quot; title=&quot;Avatar&quot;&gt;Avatar&lt;/a&gt; there is something to be said to experience something merely for an outstanding visual effects and other incidental achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>2012</title>
   <link href="/2010/07/22/2012/"/>
   <updated>2010-07-22T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2010/07/22/2012</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;So, I was somewhat dragged to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/&quot; title=&quot;2012&quot;&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt; movie for a midnight showing. I had not planed on seeing this movie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of Emmerich’s movies are more or less the same so was the really a point in seeing this one in particular. In fact the only movie I like by Ronald Emmerich is Stargate and that is only in way that I think it is a relatively stupid movie that is funny because it takes itself far to seriously (The television franchise, until very recently, was keenly aware that a great deal of that type of mythology was silly and kinda ran with the self deprecation humour. Yes, I liked the first two series and I am still on the fence about the new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway, out I went. I got the huge popcorn, which no longer comes in a tub, a comically large candy thing, and a bucket of diet coke (I am watching my figure) and readied myself for a storm out as soon as my supplies ran out. I was surprised that although my supplies did run out, and yes before you ask I did end up with a rather sore stomach in the morning, I did not leave the theatre in an outright refusal to waste anymore of my time. I am not declaring this is a good movie but it is a very good turn your brain of and watch things go boom movie and since every reviewer on the seemingly doomed earth, if I am to believe Emmerich filmography, has decided to defend their belief that it’s pretty good I to am going to defend my recommendation that its not a complete waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first problem with the film was that stupid long count myth which apparently some people believe. My assumption has always been that the world will be destroyed just like it was in the 4th millennia B.C.. You know, when the long count started. Then again it is an Emmerich and I should just be glad that aliens did not either found civilization or want to destroy it. So the convenient mythology around this date is half decent for his purposes but I did not think I would forgive this annoyance. Little did I know that research the lowest priority for the writers on this film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easier for me to explain how I came to enjoy the movie and disregard my more geek socializing nitpicking activities by telling you how the movie opens and whom I was with. This will not spoil anything because it is actually is not important to the movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was actually invited to the midnight showing by a friend on mine who has some training in Astrophysics. So much so that when the movie opened with some dramatic shots of the solar system he kept saying in that it was not to scale with that type of scoff that scientists get in their voice. My thoughts on that were simple. That cat, and a lot of Astrophysicists I have met, like Star Trek and they pull the same visual effect. Why do they do it? Simple space is dull and boring. By reducing the scale you can paint a prettier picture and correct me if I am wrong but one of the Star Trek series opening credits had a spaceship’s reflection on the rings of a planet. So if you complain about that you are just looking for something to complain about. So that opening section of the film does not throw science out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science is thrown out the window a few more minutes in. Basically it sums down to “Neutrinos have mutated”. Yeah – particles do not mutated all that often. The two people talking are ‘scientists’ so there is no particular reason for them to be speaking in metaphor. Basically this is the point I decided that science was not involved but just provided a silly excuse to destroy the world in the spectacular fashion. In fact I would like to thank Emmerich for that simply because this scene allowed me to enjoy the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The movie then proceeds to populate with a few one dimensional characters, which are well played within the limits of such a film,  that can be found throughout Emmerich films. The movie, however, is not boring it is just going through the motions but the motions are large a grandiose each method of killing an unimaginable number of people in large and fun to look at(In fact through out most of the movie I could almost hear Emmerich yelling “BIGGER”(sic) at the C.G.I. animators). In music terms its a really good cover of a silly song. You can enjoy it without it being good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of good laughs (the two best being Oliver Platt in general and something with a timer that actually got a giggle out of me), decent to good performances, and spectacular specials effects. Really that is all this movie is. I am not a huge fan of disaster movies(I think the only one I really liked is &lt;a href=&quot;&amp;quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0053137/&quot; title=&quot;On the Beach&quot;&gt;On the Beach&lt;/a&gt; and I am not sure if that is really a disaster movie). If you want to nitpick the science, the drama, or the film technics you are really watching the wrong film. If you want to learn something then the only thing you can really learn is the in the event of oncoming apocalypse you then speed and location of the disaster is dependent on the location of John Cusak with a plus or minus of 3 metres. Otherwise check your brain at the door and have some fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Date is incorrect on this article. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Citizen Kane of Video Games</title>
   <link href="/2010/04/22/the-citizen-kane-of-video-games/"/>
   <updated>2010-04-22T00:00:00-03:00</updated>

   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;No, I am not loudly announcing a new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in video games, which seems to have become popular around every major serial’s release, but rather to examine what a &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; of video games may look like. The problem I see every time somebody attempts to  label a famous title as a &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; analogous moment in video game history is that no one seems to understand why &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; is famous or assumes that film has enviable progress some how tied into the medium itself. The progress theory is simply a falsehood; there is only need for the artist. If &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures&quot;&gt;RKO&lt;/a&gt; didn’t give &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles&quot;&gt;Orson Wells&lt;/a&gt; the type of creative control and leeway that they did then &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; would not have come about – actually I think they were more interested in a &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may ask yourself what &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; and the answer is simple. It is a story that could only have been shown. Just try to explain the plot of Citizen Kane. You will become bored about halfway through. It’s basically a version of Faust – Orson may have been trying to prove &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_wilde&quot;&gt;Wilde&lt;/a&gt; right – without the devil and a bit of popular Freudism.  I believe Orson himself said that the whole Rosebud thing was a dollar book Freudian technique. A video game to reach this level must have to be a story, which could easily be a Jesus tale to fill out the Wilde quote with the added benefit that most video games are about saving the world,  that could only be played and as of my now, April 22nd 2010, this story has not happened but there has been some signs that some of the key pieces of theory about it have been laid down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that there is a need for a bit of house keeping. I obviously need to define what is meant by play. Play tends to have a sense of amusement or enjoyment but I enjoy books and can be amused at the theatre but no one would assume I was playing – hopefully not at least. The reason for this is that play is the a verb that puts me in the action inside the suspension of disbelief. You can think of actors inside of play being the players and you will get the gist of my meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since video games are called games I guess it would be useful to establish how game like they are. Ebert quite rightly points out, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html&quot; title=&quot;Video Games can Never Be Art&quot;&gt;recent blog entry&lt;/a&gt;, that very concept of game suggests that you can win or lose for that matter. We do not say we won the play or book but we still reach the intended climax of the work. So what we may ask what is particularly different between games and most cases of art is that you are intimately involved in the outcome. You win, not you watch others win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To expand a little bit further with the more classic games let me provide an example. If you play a game of chess, I am stretching a bit here because I prefer go over chess for the reason I am about to describe,  you meet the other person in a unique way. You see how they think. You can see how the mind is operating and due to the general &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos_(philosophy)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;telos&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of chess you are forced in a combative position. That is merely the rules of the game shaping the way the story plays out. I grant it would be a particular boring story even with a great amount of adjectives used in the description of such a match but still you meet the mind of the player on the board given these limitations. If we think back to one of the more famous chess games as of late we can all remember what happened when Kasparov saw something he assumed was a person and his reaction to it. He thought he has met a mind and accused IBM of cheating by allowing a human to interfere. In this sense he met deep blue. I do not think that deep blue is a subjective thing but when something happens that takes us off guard we assume a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_operandi&quot; title=&quot;Modus Operandi&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;modi operator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; behind it.  I feel this is much the case behind people unversed in evolutionary theory and are vocal about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, these more classic games always require a second person to play against. Much to the chargin‘ of misanthropic intellectuals that need to have a bit of fun. Which is what made video games a rather unique thing when they started being large set pieces as apposed to earlier sets like pong.  If I had to pin down the first major step at presenting a world I would have to say the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; game was the first to do something odd. It showed us a world with its own set of physics and sense of timing. This is also true of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac_Man&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asteroids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but those games didn’t have much of telos to them and are more about high scores. This is not much different than chess but it is without the other player and instead you are just against a certain amount of fixed problems in the world and you don’t have to live there but get to the end which honestly gives the whole concept of game a bit of a misnomer since this would be more like a puzzle with multiple solutions rather than a game. Yet they are still games because we are interacting with a &lt;em&gt;modi operator&lt;/em&gt; but in a different sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where narrative should step in but at the same time I have only seen hints towards this in Bioware games and any other game with a moral choice system. Although I have to say that in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there is less of a moral choice system than in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knights of the Old Republic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and more of choice system because the plot choices are judged by the morality of each of your companion characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally a video game’s narrative structure should be built into the idea of a conditional universe. Computer code is built on conditional statements so why not? Some have attempted to do this with the moral choice system which leads to the supposed good ending and supposed bad ending to each game but there is certainly more that can be done with the concept. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My current pet theories for a truly conditional narrative involve either a branching storyline that would lead to many different endings or the more clever version which based on what you have done in game the final ending before the credits role would allow for a different meaning of experiencing the game as whole. The only reason I think this has not been done is because it is a writer’s nightmare to be forced to have to write all those storylines or thinking in so many conditional statements to lead to a different emotional meaning to each cutscene. This is how the player should be interacting with the telos of the game to come to satisfactory emotional depth to a video games narrative but I have not seen the full potential of this idea in any game that currently exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ebert, some time ago, tweeted an article arguing that &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid_Prime:_Trilogy&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is not the &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt; of gaming.   I agree so let’s just knock off for coffee – but while we have that coffee let us have a bit of meditation on why someone would ever dare to claim that. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGO1OJazlsc&quot;&gt;Michael Thomsen&lt;/a&gt; goes on at some length about integration and of character and player. The chief problem with this idea is that Samus Aran is less of a character than she is an avatar – I do not mean she is ten feet tall and blue. For those of us that spent some of our time playing the Original &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; will remember the moment when we finally made it through the world of Zebes to discover that Samus was a girl. Or to put it more accurately we were a girl. This is an important idea which seems to be lost and I think Metroid is on of the earlier examples of how this particular function of video game psychology works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you talk to a a person playing a video game with a life system you will notice that they usually say “I have so many lives” as opposed to “I have x number of attempts to get through this particular puzzle.” The same goes for health metres and ammunition. The character never has these items, you do. This is just one of the types of suspension of disbelief that is assumed of video games. The forth wall is not the screen or the edge of theatre. It is the controller and you become somewhat integrated with the avatar. Despite the fact that I have never been to planet Zebes to fight the metroids and space pirates when referencing the story to someone else, I still have destroyed a few metroids in my time when I think about the personal experience of playing the game. Or to return to chess I have never taken a castle in my life but at the same time I have taken many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason I am referencing &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; so much here is because this is the &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime&lt;/em&gt; series strong point. The only time you see Samus is in cut scenes and reflections. The problem with a &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime&lt;/em&gt; series is that, despite being fun, the entire story of three games spanning about 40 hours of my life fit on the back of about 6 postcards. I am not estimating here. Nintendo has published a story primer in the recent trilogy set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camera control has become important since &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_64&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but I can think of only one game that used it exceptionally well. This game is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Ancel&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michel Ancel’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Good_&amp;amp;_Evil_(video_game)&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beyond Good and Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not entirely Camera Control but a combination of camera control and set design. One particular moment is that when you are crawling around the run off sewers attempting to hide from the Alpha Sections the only way to check on their status is to tilt the camera angle at a rather steep angle. Not only this but the holes which you can get of are nearly completely taken up by one Alpha Section soldier passing by. I always found this to be a good idea taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;12 Angry Men&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to intensify claustrophobia and stress. Camera and level design should meld in this way to help with emotional identification. And to be fair many video games have taken good ideas about camera angles from cinema despite the fact very few outside cinematic cut scenes have any sort of emotional rationale which is annoying.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final bit I would like to address is music. Which is by far the most under utilized thing in video games. There have been some great songs floating about video game land for quite some time and my iTunes library can attest to that but it is rarely used as part of the narrative flow except in a few cases like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VI&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_3&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Music in video games needs to be more operatic than cinema because of the shear amount of time that you must listen to it. To put it another way. Both Final Fantasy VI and Persona 3 take around 60 hours a piece to finish. Meaning you could listen the entire &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Ring_des_Nibelungen&quot; title=&quot;Wagner&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring of Nibelung&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 4 times given the same amount of time. Now I grant that a video game is not entirely about music but anyone that has played a video game should realize that music is always playing in the background and if have an artistic goal in mind really the music should have some more resonance beyond tone especially given there are long stretches where no one talks. It should, in some way, be helping the narrative along or have some meaning at the ending that it didn’t have when each element of it was introduced. My example here would be to take each &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;leitmotif&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of each character - including the antagonist - when you first encounter them and that what do the songs mean to you when the accumulated in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBGeAv3oq-s&quot;&gt;Dancing Mad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh-JASWXr9g&quot;&gt;Final March&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VI&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing this because I wanted to concentrate my ideas the more artistic side of video games which in itself was prompted by Ebert’s proclamation that &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html&quot;&gt;video games will never be art&lt;/a&gt;. Although I disagree with the never, which he admits to would be silly, but I also disagree – mind this is just those last remnants of hope that I have managed to maintain – that it is not going to happen in this generation. I am willing to say that it will happen within this generation of people just because of there are enough people interested in advancing video games as an art form. Someone may be able to shuffle past the current corporate paradigm. Much like how Orson Welles bypassed the usual Hollywood crap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now almost every game that is released is more like an experiment than a work of art. The Metroid Prime series can be considered like &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Eisenstein&quot;&gt;Eisenstien’s&lt;/a&gt; early experiments in montage but not &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015648/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battleship Potemkin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and so on. There are some games that are pretty good but to me they seem more like moustachioed villains tying women to railroad tracks rather than some statement of the human condition. &lt;em&gt;Beyond Good and Evil&lt;/em&gt;, although it is one of my favourite games, broke the mould slightly with its story being more about the choice of who you are by your actions and relationships over genetic meaning to life;  it didn’t quite go far enough and it really did not take full advantage of medium. I do look forward to the day that the artist appears and makes a culturally significant game where I will learn something new about myself and world around me in such a way that it could only have been played but that game does not exist …. yet.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The State of the User</title>

   <updated>2010-04-21T00:00:00-03:00</updated>
   <id>/2010/04/21/the-state-of-the-user</id>
   <content type="html">
   &lt;p&gt;Since this is an inaugural post from a &lt;em&gt;computational elite philosopher&lt;/em&gt; let me start things off with a discussion on the three major desktop environments that people may be using in order to get here. This means I will be discussing the Juggernaut that is Microsoft Windows; Apple’s Mac OSX, including their interesting thoughts about how a computer should be sold; and finally GNU/Linux, which I simply refer to as Linux. So let’s get things rolling with and start with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Window’s main problem is that it was never designed to be exceptional. It is designed to work and that’s about it. Those of us that can remember Windows 3.1 will remember a kind of sub-standard System 7 (Macintosh). The revolution came with Windows 95 and the fact that computer hardware prices plummeted around the same time. Again, I would like to remind all Microsoft fans that I am not discussing things that the user does not see like the NT kernel. So although there were pretty amazing advancements at Microsoft at the time it is outside my current scope. The revolution that I am referring to is the Start menu and task bar. This was completely different than anything else in existence. All of your programs were placed in one convenient location and you would always know where new programs went. This idea is found today in both KDE and Gnome and it is arguable that the Leopard stacks is a more versatile version of the same idea (Just try putting your application folder in a stack and it is more or less the same) Microsoft then made a lot of money on this idea and has simply sat on the side lines for many years in the User Experience (UE) field for many years. There has been some minor changes , i.e. the ribbons in Microsoft office I find to be much more appropriate given how Windows treats programs but there has been no major changes to UE for many years. There are two reasons for this. The most obvious one is that Microsoft is afraid of completely alienating their user base so they are stuck with the ideas which came with their popularity. The second is that Microsoft has around 90 percent of the desktop market so they do not need to be exceptional. This saddens me because given the sheer girth of the company you think they could be on the forefront of UE but then again keeping the monopoly is more of concern. They do this by less than savory methods which I am sure is distracting. It is now time to move on and to stop ragging on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Macintosh operating system is really the antithesis of Windows. It is designed to be the best thing since sliced bread(I am not sure why sliced bread is so innovative since I always seem to own a breadknife but that is besides the point). They do this by synthesizing hardware and software into one unique device and consider that to be their product. This caused by the infulence of the two founding members of Apple that are named Steve. Steve Wozniak (The Woz) is a man that makes stuff. He does interesting things while making stuff that makes it hard to be versatile. Anyone that has a Lisa with the Twiggy drives might be aware of his genus. Steve Jobs is to be honest an insane tyrant. Any glance at the stories on &lt;a href=&quot;http://folklore.org/&quot;&gt;folklore.org&lt;/a&gt; will show this aspect of his personality. This is not to say that he doesn’t have good ideas but this rather to say that any idea he does have, &lt;a href=&quot;http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;amp;story=Reality_Distortion_Field.txt&amp;amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;amp;detail=medium&amp;amp;search=steve%20jobs&quot; title=&quot;Reality Distortion Field&quot;&gt;or heard about somewhere,&lt;/a&gt; is pushed through to the system. One of my favorite stories is &lt;a href=&quot;http://folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;amp;story=Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.txt&amp;amp;sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&amp;amp;detail=medium&amp;amp;search=steve%20jobs&quot;&gt;how rounded rectangles ended up on the first Mac&lt;/a&gt; when they didn’t hit Photoshop until 5.5 or 6. His way goes. The Macintosh product line is the object of his tyranny. The combination of hardware design that is not versatile and the lack of versatility of tyranny have yielded some interesting results. First the UE concept that is unique to Apple is that it extends beyond the screen. The command key (oh how I miss you Apple key{I know that it was always the command key but still:(}) is placed where the thumb can get at it. Since to a person that actually types, the thumb is useless linking the major keyboard shortcuts to the thumb is a great boon for efficiency and comfort. No emacs pinky here! Global Menus refuse to leave the system and are very useful so I always look at the same spot to get to special commands. Spatial browsing concepts attached to all windows is great even though that there has been some loss there over the years. This is just the old hat stuff but since OSX there have been some changes. The Dock sits in my neither good nor bad category. It is similar to the windows taskbar but the magnification feature annoys me and I usually have it turned off. Now that Spotlight launches programs quite well, it is, simply put, fantastic and has been ported by third party developers to both Windows and Linux. Smart folders are okay but more can be done with such a concept which I will discuss later. Finally the machines themselves are usually fairly good looking. All of this goes in the Apple good book but is impossible with large amount of first oppression and then indoctrination. This is Cocoa’s primary function. It is dead easy with Cocoa to make an application that looks good on Mac at the cost of breaking compatibility with other Operating Systems. That is the rewards for developers playing ball. Read Foucault to get at my meaning here. All of this said the tyranny here is not so much a bad thing in my case because I don’t care that much about freedom for my tools. I just need my stuff to work properly and quickly. If freedom is your thing, then we shall move on to Linux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux for desktop users is the new kid on the block and talking about UE is difficult consider the large amount of choice with the various desktop environments and I do not find much innovation on that front except that the AWN dock has some animation features that are both impressive and less annoying than the magnification dock. Instead I want to talk about the problems that Linux is faced with. The first problem is the emulation issue. GNU and Linux was developed to emulate Unix. No one argues with this point and to be honest I can rarely tell the difference. This is not to say I can not tell the difference I occasionally use seq or something else in my scripts and forget that it is a gnu thing. While this is not much of problem on the command line, in fact it is very good thing on the command line, the concept has been magnified onto the GUI front which is a problem for innovation. Both Gnome and KDE emulate the start bar and there are various hacks to get each system closer to either &lt;a href=&quot;http://maketecheasier.com/turn-your-ubuntu-hardy-to-mac-osx-leopard/2008/07/23&quot;&gt;Mac&lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href=&quot;http://ubuntu.online02.com/node/14&quot;&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Sure stuff can be more stable and have the occasional feature which is better than all the other counterparts but what about a whole new UE that will change the way I think about using my computer. I do not think this will happen in Linux for both this reason the next one. Linux is Free. Woohoo. It is a free system and allows for people to see how it is built and spread it around. This is great but there are various benefits lost from the other models which most Terminal Heads I meet tend to forget. I shall use a recent example from Gnome to make this point clear. In the newer version of Gnome you can shut down from the usual spot or from the user bar. My first response was why to which my Terminal Head friend responded some people want to do that and wrote the code. This is not good UE because it allows for the option even though only some people want it. Shut down is one process with a few options like restart and hibernate, yes Steve I am wondering why you let that one slip by you. In order for you to become efficient with this process there must be one and precisely von way to do it. Besides my own tyrannical ideals it is also conceptually confusing. The user menu should only have actions that are associated with what the user can do, like logout, but the shut down process is sending a signal to the hardware and not just the operating system. This should have a different menu all together. I know this is not a big problem but it still a problem that shows that the very freedom Linux advocates adhere to is slowing them down. It’s fine if you hack something to best set your needs, in fact that is great, but when that filters to the binaries of major distributions this is major problem. Linux needs a better tyrant than the GNU license. It needs it to innovate and quiet some of the voices screaming in its UE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where do we go from here.  So where do we go from herrre  Is Linux forever doomed to be cluttered with multiple personalities? Is Microsoft ever going to be innovative again? If Steve Jobs ever retires from his tyranny will Mac become mediocre? Well I do not know to be honest but there are some glimmers of hope. I believe that perfect mix of desktop users would be to split everything into thirds. One third using Windows, another using Mac, and the last third using Open Source and/or Free Software(I include BSD and OpenSolaris here). This would create a competitive environment for UE which would make want to design better systems to attract both users and developers to build good systems.It would also drop the idea that a computer is just like any other. They are not. You should pick the best that suits you but also the makers of UE should be competing to make the best UE for you. Google may be the forth column here. The Gmail interface, more than any other Google product, has shown me some hope. It stores everything in the unimaginable cloud but its UE allows me to type out my email and label it efficiently. Smart Folders are similar but tagging is more versatile. I can move some of the stuff around to suit my preferences, e.g. I have my labels on the right side, and never have to waste my time looking for things. This is not to say it is perfect. Far from it but I think this is the appropriate mix of tyranny and freedom for a release that has not be hacked by me. And who knows maybe Windows 7 or the upcoming newer kernel may be the best thing ever, maybe Mac with continue to make little addenda to their formula to and continue to be good, or maybe a new Desktop Environment will follow the Cathedral OpenSource model and create some new and better which will leave the rest of the systems in the dust. I have no idea what is on the horizon but one thing is for sure. I will probably end up using all of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(As a note: I wrote this a while ago and this no longer representative of my views.)&lt;/p&gt;
