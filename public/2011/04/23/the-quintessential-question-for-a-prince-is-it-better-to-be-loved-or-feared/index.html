		<p>Well, it seems the Hitchens is up to his usual tricks. You know being a brilliant author but at the same time vaguely annoying to both those that object to his views and those that are almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Hitchens himself (I miss Douglas Adams’ voice amongst the British atheists). </p>

<p>The article <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2291497/">in question</a> is well written and posits an argument, which is something that most journalists seem to be terrified to do as of late, but it is the argument that I dislike. Now, I am not a huge fan of any of the iterations of the <em>House of Saxe-Coburg, and Gotha</em>  but I am not particularly against them either or any of the Royal Houses for that matter – except one time when I was 19 but I was being a prick at the time. </p>

<p>So late me take you through the flaws, or at least the contestable sections of his argument for a British Republic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The queen took two major decisions quite early in her reign, neither of which was forced upon her. She refused to allow her younger sister Margaret to marry the man she loved and had chosen, and she let her authoritarian husband have charge of the education of her eldest son. The first decision was taken to appease the most conservative leaders of the Church of England (a church of which she is, absurdly, the head), who could not approve the marriage of Margaret to a divorced man. The second was taken for reasons less clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both of these decisions are internal family matters. Poor Margaret was left to chum the waters of a sorrowful sea because of the strange conventions of the British public circa 1950. I don’t think any family, at the time, would be quite so happy to welcome a divorced man into the family. Hell in the year 2011 my father is dating a divorced women and there is still the vague whiff of scandal amongst some the idiots that he associates himself with.</p>

<p>And as for the boarding school thing, which he is alluding to by having Prince Phillip’s taking charge of Charles education. That is just what was done of people in a certain class at that time as recounted in Steven Fry’s book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moab_Is_My_Washpot:_An_Autobiography"><em>Moab is my washpot</em></a>. Even then I am from a family that was not particularly wealthy and I went off to boarding school in the late ’90s and the early part of the new Millennia and there was not a particular shortage of students, that I noticed. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Together, Margaret and Charles set the tone for the dowdy, feckless, can’t-stay-married shower of titled descendants with whose names, let alone doings, it is near-impossible to keep up. There are so many of them! And things always have to be found for them to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is some more to his analysis of the problems of Charles and Margaret but you can read the article in full latter but is really necessary to bring these peoples misery out on the stage yet again. Yes, mistakes were made in the family which lead to unhappy lives but what family has not made these types of mistakes. I have never sat a family table, I rarely sit at my own due to our dwindling numbers, that there was some sense vendetta and resentment next to the bread and to the left of the of the salt and pepper shakers. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For Prince William at least it was decided on the day of his birth what he should do: Find a presentable wife, father a male heir (and preferably a male “spare” as well), and keep the show on the road. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Umm …. how is this different from anybody eles. I am pretty sure my gay friend’s parents are still hoping this from him. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[W]hen the Old Guard began snickering about the pedigree of young Ms. Middleton. Her parents, it appeared, were not quite out of the top drawer. The mother had been an air hostess or something with an unfashionable airline, and the family had been overheard using lethally wrong expressions, such as serviette for napkin, settee for sofa, and—I can barely bring myself to type the shameful letters—toilet for lavatory. Ah, so that’s what constitutes vulgarity! People who would never dare risk a public criticism of the royal family, even in its daytime-soap incarnation, prefer to take a surreptitious revenge on a young woman of modest background. For shame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree but this is just the family being a bit stuffy. I remember being shoved into suits and being told to speak properly by my mother. Still it has nothing to do with the state and those rules of proprietary come from the British people not the Royals themselves. They do not exist in a vacuum. </p>

<p>I guess my problem of this republican opportunism of Hitchens is that most of problems that he is talking about have to do with problem of living under the constant and watchful of eyes of the British public. Every failure in their lives is recorded and talked about and every success remember for a bittersweet moment and then dismissed by that public, which claims to love them, as the benefits of being born or a certain station. </p>

<p>Sure they are a bit of quirky, particularly German, family but that doesn’t mean they should be stripped of position. </p>

<p>And notice I said position. The reigning monarch has very little real substantive power. They no longer instill any fear in the public. They are symbolic family, with some means of their own I should mention, which provides a service to the public – chiefly bestowing honours on the public. And the public loves them for that reason.  </p>

<p>Which has a bit of irony to it considering the public’s thing seems to be to repeatedly and viciously victimize these people as only the feckless thuggery of true democracy can muster – or stomach. </p>
