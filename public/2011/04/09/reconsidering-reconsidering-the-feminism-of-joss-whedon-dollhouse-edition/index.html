		<p>A couple of days ago <a href="https://twitter.com/lschmeiser/status/56054822234890240" title="Via twitter obviously. I don't know any cool smart people personally.">Lisa Schmeiser linked me to an article</a> and something irked me about it. I wasn’t sure what it was and I happened to be busy that day so it did not occupy much of my mind space. Still the article seemed to be sitting in the back of the my mind throwing a tennis ball, distractingly, against my prefrontal cortex.</p>

<p>I hate it when this happens and honestly it hasn’t happened for quite some time but this morning while I was sitting in my favourite café I overheard some of the people that worked in my almae matris – my, I have moved far haven’t I – nattering on about their various student’s theses. The tennis ball started going faster. Not since my undergrad had I heard such failed attempts at understanding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler" title="Not really a Dame (British Sense)">Dame Judy Butler</a>. So then armed with thoughts about subjectivity, objectivity, and gender I went back to the article, which was written by <a href="http://natface.tumblr.com/">Natasha Simons</a></p>

<p>The article starts off fine enough but Natasha seems to be shocked that there is violence in an action show. Some people don’t like action <em>dramas</em> and that’s okay. There are other things on TV. But that section does not really bother me. This section on the other hand … </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you’ll permit the academic tangent, Dollhouse merits recollection of film critic Laura Mulvey and her brilliant thesis, which identified the gaze of the audience in film (or television, updated) as male. It also identified the gaze of the writer and director as male, and the ways in which that manifests itself onscreen. Mulvey found that a disturbing thread had emerged in cinema, a psychological expression of male insecurity: when a female character is strong or otherwise opaque to the male viewer, there are generally two options at hand. The visual medium tends to answer the anxiety of the male by “demystifying the mystery, counterbalanced by the punishment of the guilty object.” What this means in layman’s terms is that the woman must be unmasked (usually by sexual intercourse) or punished with harm for refusing to submit. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to be what irked me a bit because I know that Whedon is somewhat Sartrean himself so I am not entirely sure that this subconscious desire which Mulvey was talking about is necessarily a problem for Whedon. After all the whole concept of <em>Buffy: The Vampire Slayer</em> was by the reversal of subject and object in the sentence “Cute blonde girl gets destroyed by monster” that was in many of the scripts that Mulvey is talking about. </p>

<p>The article does not end there. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… Echo is the ultimate male fantasy – she is a woman that literally anything can be done to for the right amount of money, with those actions then simply erased afterward. See, it’s all right, because she (and the other dolls) won’t remember! The show perpetrates the worst kinds of violence on its female characters. Over the course of the two seasons on-air, Echo is repeatedly used for intercourse and made to pretend she enjoys it, one woman is removed from doll status because of a physical deformity, another female is steadily and terrifyingly raped by her male handler – and even the term “handler” suggests a male role intended to actively control …  Putting [Echo] in a variety of sexy spandex and ever-more dangerous situations is a thrill, and the audience, watching, also thrilled, is complicit in Echo’s subjugation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Umm, I seem to remember stubbornly watching this show and I don’t remember siding with the any of the perpetrators of these actions. In fact I think the show went to great lengths to demonize the people in control of the Dollhouse network and made damn sure that the Dolls where seen as victims. </p>

<p>In a tawdry sense wouldn’t this make a the show more feminist. It depicts a world where men abuse their power and money to use women (well mainly women) who were so victimized by the male run world that they had to run and hide. Then their hiding place perpetuates their victimization and eventually they are forced to take action against their oppressors. Overall isn’t that the story arc of the Dollhouse series.</p>

<p>I guess I don’t get this critique and I can’t really see where it is coming from other than a desire to talk about Joss Whedon’s supposed feminism.(Did he ever claim to be one, out of curiosity, or was it that a lot of self labeled third wavers happened to like Buffy?) </p>

<p>Honestly, I always thought of <em>Dollhouse</em> as a failed attempt of Whedon’s to explore his ideas about subjectivity versus objectivity and the interplay between the two in an age of brain/mind sciences. Kinda a second attempt at dealing with some of the <a href="http://bit.ly/gBVPHu" title="relevant episodes">themes of Firefly</a> in a new wrapper. </p>

<p>There were many faults with the series but I don’t think it was necessarily antagonistic to the feminist ascete.</p>
