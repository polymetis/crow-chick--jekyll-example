		<p>I am a keyboard enthusiast. My keyboard of choice was made in the early ’90s, the venerable <a href="http://lowendmac.com/thomas/06/1019.html">Apple Extended II</a>, and this keyboard is an ADB monstrosity that is actually heavier than my current primary, and only, computer; a Macbook Pro 13 inch(Mid-2010).  All this means is that I have quite obviously been working with computers for a long time and have developed a lot of cranky old man habits in my workflow despite the fact I am still at a tender age.  All of this must be understood if anything wonderful is going to come from this little tale.</p>

<p>It starts, as many tales do, by something bouncing on the docks. The Mac App Store had finally launched and I was fiddling around with it. At some juncture I saw a small bowler that looked a little familiar. The icon was for an app named <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>, presumably after the most famous butler in popular fiction. I had encounter Alfred once before in the summertime. A friend of mine called it a better version of spotlight and just left it that. I looked at the site in passing but was feeling lazy and promptly forgot about the application.</p>

<p>Now here it was again. Sitting there. So hat like and one thing I know from my experience is that if a hat is just sitting in a room someone is going to have to put it on. Why do you think that Crown Jewels are so heavily guarded? So with one click of the mouse I put on the damn hat.</p>

<p>I went over my life with computers and thought about all the little quirks that each system brought. From the days of using my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_file_manager">spatial memory to find what file</a> or program  I wanted to work with to the present and my life with finder, spotlight, and safari. The workflow was always to decide on what I needed the computer to do and where to do it. It is how it always been.</p>

<p>Then I started to use the program. At first he seemed just a bit faster than the norm and easier to read than spotlight. Nothing that special but then the wondrous thing happened. I typed the name of a program I did not have on my computer. It was on the old one and I had not reinstalled since getting the a new one.</p>

<p>Hitting return, more out of habit than anything, I was presented with a google search for the application and the top of the page. Within a few seconds I was doing what I had intended on doing despite my error.</p>

<p>The internet had always been a wilderness that the timid spotlight dare not step outside the fine cobbled streets of my well organized machine. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgeAQioXyYA#t=24s" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred has no fear of this jungle</a> If he doesn’t see what you are looking for locally he allows you to channel your search off to the greater world.</p>

<p>I sat and thought about my old ways where the internet and the local machine were to be treated differently. The projected future of clouds ceased having rainbows in it and started being wet and cold. A world where I would not only have to think where the application might be and its purpose but whether or not that application was online or offline and even if I was connected. My head began to swirl. The OS simply did not extend into the world. It stayed home and I was its prisoner.</p>

<p>The future, and my freedom, from the chains of the local versus networked computer model seem to be broken by Alfred. The weight of picking the right program has been taken off my shoulder and put onto his. Now all I have to do is decide on what I want to do not where I want to do it.</p>

<p>As an added side effect of this program,﻿ my apartment is now filled with the soft melody of alps switches … switching. Gone are the cacophonic stops to switch from home row to the swiping and clicking world of the magic mouse.</p>

<p>This has made me a happier man. If not a mildly fanciful and hyperbolic man.</p>
