		<p><a href="http://dresdencodak.com/">Aaron Diaz</a> has been tweeting about <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> (not sure the colon is necessary anymore) and this has made me nostalgic for the days that family friendly was not restricted solely to Doctor Who.</p>

<p>I feel that this is loss to the general public because if there is one thing that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_William_Shatner_Changed_the_World" title="How William Shatner Changed The World">William Shatner has made clear is that a great many children were inspired by Star Trek to create an actual better future</a>. At the same time I realize that Paramount made two terrible series and that Deep Space Nine is the only good one from that post-Roddenberry era ; even then only after it found its footing.</p>

<p>I shouldn’t even say that Voyager was a complete a write off either. There were some good episodes but they are spread few and far between and usually involve <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Doctor" title="The Non-British Doctor with No Name">Robert Picardo</a> or <a href="http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/B%27Elanna_Torres" title="B'Ellanna Torres">Roxann Dawson</a> dealing with an ontological crisis — I freely admit I am sympathetic towards Belanna story lines because I come from a multicultural household where my more recognizable lineage was the less dominate in my childhood. What can I say, I am a narcissist.</p>

<p>Some people blame techno-bable for this demise; others blame attempts to use ‘T and A’ for increasing viewership; some just say that it is anachronic form of story telling; and I have even heard, and to my shame repeated, that it was entirely because the Janeway and Archer were not very good captains because of Kate Mulgrew and Scott Bakula.</p>

<p>All of those reasons are crap. The Original Star Trek, The Next Generation, and Deep Space Nine had their fair share of techno-bable - there was less of it granted but almost every mousetrap solution across all the Star Treks involves one actor spouting gibberish and then a second actor over-simplifying. The increasingly pretty cast is simply part of what is happening culturally with the new found cult to the body being amplified by Hollywood - hell just look at the cast of Cheers and compare them to the cast of How I Met Your Mother. The anachronic argument is out simply because a great many sci fi shows are trying to distance themselves from Star Trek either because they disliked Star Trek personally or trying to keep themselves from being rejected from Creative executives by disassociating their sci fi show from the failure of Voyager and Enterprise. And finally the captain thing is true to a certain extant because Kirk, Picard, and Sisko are all awesome in their unique way which was a strange hybrid between script and actor, whereas Janeway and Archer are mehish but I think that was just a symptom of script problems rather than a problem on the casting level.</p>

<p>Since I disregarded all these reasons I must put forth my own theory. After all this is the internet. So what is considerate and wise opinion? Star Trek started sucking because more and more episodes started being about Star Trek.</p>

<p>When Roddenberry was kicking around Star Trek’s basic idea was an idealized form, particularly Humanist and oddly liberal considering the lack of capitalism, of Humanity was trekking around and encountering ‘other’ beings that had  problems which represented, usually in concentrated form, the problems of today. “But they have black on the other side of their body” queue Kirk face palm, “We have an asexual society but I think I am both a girl and am obviously sexually different despite how hard I try to hide it and I worry about societies judgment — also your beard makes me feel giddy.” queue bearded Riker makeout session, etc. etc.</p>

<p>It is simple enough formula but it works simply because it posits a workable solution as a completed action. The very existence of the advanced form of humanity in a utopic state is the worked out solution and then they, the future humans, have the opportunity to discuss and solve the problems of today through the use of the alien metaphor. It is essentially, for all you grammarians out there, a decent use of the future perfect.</p>

<p>Deep Space Nine is a little different because when it became ‘good’ it mainly dealt with racism and the concept of how much of your principles, the idealist form of principles, could be sacrificed in its defence which honestly rings more true in the post September 11th world than the world of the ’90s.</p>

<p>Voyager, on the other hand, was about … ? … I don’t know really know. It could have been about forging new alliances, or as Babylon 5 put it “humans build communities”. It could have been about ontology - how much of the objective stuff that you are made of influences what you do - and to be honest the best episodes of the series hover around these ideas.  Hell it could have been what it means to have a home and then to be so far away from it that it would be unlikely to see it again.</p>

<p>It is about none of these things but I get sense that it is trying to be all these things. When you have all these things pulling into various directions then all you really have is the core of the show, and the core of Star Trek is kinda of silly, if it can’t explore in any particular direction.</p>

<p>This is why we complain about the techno-bable and everything else. The show became about the plot of each episode rather than the metaphor which is a shame. I feel like the cast was capable of much more than what they were given and the character were most certainly capable of much more than what we saw.</p>

<p>Enterprise was even worse because it was about how that core came into existence plot wise. Instead of the transporter being invented by a writer to save on production costs there was an entire show on the why and hows the tech came in being. Instead of gene splicing not being addressed by the first two series simply because gene splicing was not really in the public knowledge at the time we have a whole song and dance about it — in fact I think it was a two parter and I am sure there are other examples but my contact with Enterprise has been limited to me checking in on the series sporadically after I got pissed off at the episode where the Dog gets sick, then something about a bat, and oh the hilarity because nothing says hijinks like a beloved pet having a terminal disease.</p>

<p>Star Trek was supposed to be about our better selves exploring the problems caused by our lesser demons that we have today rather than exploring itself. It is supposed to be the fiction that exalts us not the explanation of 10 000 facts about fictive technology and science.</p>

<p>I miss having a better self on television because when the tv is off all I can see is the dark reflection of me as I am.</p>
